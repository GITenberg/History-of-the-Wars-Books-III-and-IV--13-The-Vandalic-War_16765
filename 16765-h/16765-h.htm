<span class="sidenote">Jan. 17, 395 A.D.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_i_1" id="PageIII_i_1">[1-3]</a></span>
<p>Such, then, was the final outcome of the Persian War for the Emperor
Justinian; and I shall now proceed to set forth all that he did
against the Vandals and the Moors. But first shall be told whence came
the host of the Vandals when they descended upon the land of the
Romans. After Theodosius, the Roman Emperor, had departed from the
world, having proved himself one of the most just of men and an able
warrior, his kingdom was taken over by his two sons, Arcadius, the
elder, receiving the Eastern portion, and Honorius, the younger, the
Western. But the Roman power had been thus divided as far back as the
time of Constantine and his sons; for he transferred his government to
Byzantium, and making the city larger and much more renowned, allowed
it to be named after him.
</p>
<p>Now the earth is surrounded by a circle of ocean, either entirely or
for the most part (for our knowledge is not as yet at all clear in
this matter); and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_i_4" id="PageIII_i_4">[4-9]</a></span> is split into two continents by a sort of
outflow from the ocean, a flow which enters at the western part and
forms this Sea which we know, beginning at Gadira<a name="FNanchor_1_III" id="FNanchor_1_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_III" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and extending all
the way to the Maeotic Lake.<a name="FNanchor_2_III" id="FNanchor_2_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_III" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Of these two continents the one to the
right, as one sails into the Sea, as far as the Lake, has received the
name of Asia, beginning at Gadira and at the southern<a name="FNanchor_3_III" id="FNanchor_3_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_III" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the two
Pillars of Heracles. Septem<a name="FNanchor_4_III" id="FNanchor_4_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_III" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is the name given by the natives to the
fort at that point, since seven hills appear there; for "septem" has
the force of "seven" in the Latin tongue. And the whole continent
opposite this was named Europe. And the strait at that point separates
the two continents<a name="FNanchor_5_III" id="FNanchor_5_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_III" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> by about eighty-four stades, but from there on
they are kept apart by wide expanses of sea as far as the Hellespont.
For at this point they again approach each other at Sestus and Abydus,
and once more at Byzantium and Chalcedon as far as the rocks called in
ancient times the "Dark Blue Rocks," where even now is the place
called Hieron. For at these places the continents are separated from
one another by a distance of only ten stades and even less than that.
</p>
<p>Now the distance from one of the Pillars of Heracles to the other, if
one goes along the shore and does not pass around the Ionian Gulf and
the sea called the Euxine but crosses from Chalcedon<a name="FNanchor_6_III" id="FNanchor_6_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_III" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to Byzantium
and from Dryous<a name="FNanchor_7_III" id="FNanchor_7_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_III" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to the opposite mainland,<a name="FNanchor_8_III" id="FNanchor_8_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_III" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_i_9" id="PageIII_i_9">[9-15]</a></span> is a journey of
two hundred and eighty-five days for an unencumbered traveller. For as
to the land about the Euxine Sea, which extends from Byzantium to the
Lake, it would be impossible to tell everything with precision, since
the barbarians beyond the Ister River, which they also call the
Danube, make the shore of that sea quite impossible for the Romans to
traverse&mdash;except, indeed, that from Byzantium to the mouth of the
Ister is a journey of twenty-two days, which should be added to the
measure of Europe by one making the computation. And on the Asiatic
side, that is from Chalcedon to the Phasis River, which, flowing from
the country of the Colchians, descends into the Pontus, the journey is
accomplished in forty days. So that the whole Roman domain, according
to the distance along the sea at least, attains the measure of a three
hundred and forty-seven days' journey, if, as has been said, one
ferries over the Ionian Gulf, which extends about eight hundred stades
from Dryous. For the passage across the gulf<a name="FNanchor_9_III" id="FNanchor_9_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_III" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> amounts to a journey
of not less than four days. Such, then, was the size of the Roman
empire in the ancient times.
</p>
<p>And there fell to him who held the power in the West the most of
Libya, extending ninety days' journey&mdash;for such is the distance from
Gadira to the boundaries of Tripolis in Libya; and in Europe he
received as his portion territory extending seventy-five days'
journey&mdash;for such is the distance from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_i_15" id="PageIII_i_15">[15-2]</a></span> northern<a name="FNanchor_10_III" id="FNanchor_10_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_III" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of the
Pillars of Heracles to the Ionian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_11_III" id="FNanchor_11_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_III" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And one might add also the
distance around the gulf. And the emperor of the East received
territory extending one hundred and twenty days' journey, from the
boundaries of Cyrene in Libya as far as Epidamnus, which lies on the
Ionian Gulf and is called at the present time Dyrrachium, as well as
that portion of the country about the Euxine Sea which, as previously
stated, is subject to the Romans. Now one day's journey extends two
hundred and ten stades,<a name="FNanchor_12_III" id="FNanchor_12_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_III" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> or as far as from Athens to Megara. Thus,
then, the Roman emperors divided either continent between them. And
among the islands Britain, which is outside the Pillars of Heracles
and by far the largest of all islands, was counted, as is natural,
with the West; and inside the Pillars, Ebusa,<a name="FNanchor_13_III" id="FNanchor_13_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_III" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which lies in the
Mediterranean in what we may call the Propontis, just inside the
opening where the ocean enters, about seven days' journey from the
opening, and two others near it, Majorica and Minorica, as they are
called by the natives, were also assigned to the Western empire. And
each of the islands in the Sea itself fell to the share of that one of
the two emperors within whose boundaries it happened to lie.
</p><br />
<p>II</p>
<span class="sidenote">395-423 A.D</span>

<p>Now while Honorius was holding the imperial power in the West,
barbarians took possession of his land; and I shall tell who they were
and in what manner they did so. There were many Gothic nations
in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ii_2" id="PageIII_ii_2">[2-8]</a></span> earlier times, just as also at the present, but the greatest
and most important of all are the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths, and
Gepaedes. In ancient times, however, they were named Sauromatae and
Melanchlaeni;<a name="FNanchor_14_III" id="FNanchor_14_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_III" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and there were some too who called these nations
Getic. All these, while they are distinguished from one another by
their names, as has been said, do not differ in anything else at all.
For they all have white bodies and fair hair, and are tall and
handsome to look upon, and they use the same laws and practise a
common religion. For they are all of the Arian faith, and have one
language called Gothic; and, as it seems to me, they all came
originally from one tribe, and were distinguished later by the names
of those who led each group. This people used to dwell above the Ister
River from of old. Later on the Gepaedes got possession of the country
about Singidunum<a name="FNanchor_15_III" id="FNanchor_15_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_III" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and Sirmium,<a name="FNanchor_16_III" id="FNanchor_16_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_III" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> on both sides of the Ister
River, where they have remained settled even down to my time.
</p>
<p>But the Visigoths, separating from the others, removed from there and
at first entered into an alliance with the Emperor Arcadius, but at a
later time (for faith with the Romans cannot dwell in barbarians),
under the leadership of Alaric, they became hostile to both emperors,
and, beginning with Thrace, treated all Europe as an enemy's land. Now
the Emperor Honorius had before this time been sitting in Rome, with
never a thought of war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ii_8" id="PageIII_ii_8">[8-15]</a></span> in his mind, but glad, I think, if men
allowed him to remain quiet in his palace. But when word was brought
that the barbarians with a great army were not far off, but somewhere
among the Taulantii,<a name="FNanchor_17_III" id="FNanchor_17_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_III" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> he abandoned the palace and fled in
disorderly fashion to Ravenna, a strong city lying just about at the
end of the Ionian Gulf, while some say that he brought in the
barbarians himself, because an uprising had been started against him
among his subjects; but this does not seem to me trustworthy, as far,
at least, as one can judge of the character of the man. And the
barbarians, finding that they had no hostile force to encounter them,
became the most cruel of all men. For they destroyed all the cities
which they captured, especially those south of the Ionian Gulf, so
completely that nothing has been left to my time to know them by,
unless, indeed, it might be one tower or one gate or some such thing
which chanced to remain. And they killed all the people, as many as
came in their way, both old and young alike, sparing neither women nor
children. Wherefore even up to the present time Italy is sparsely
populated. They also gathered as plunder all the money out of all
Europe, and, most important of all, they left in Rome nothing whatever
of public or private wealth when they moved on to Gaul. But I shall
now tell how Alaric captured Rome.
</p>
<p>After much time had been spent by him in the siege, and he had not
been able either by force or by any other device to capture the place,
he formed the following plan. Among the youths in the army whose
beards had not yet grown, but who had just come of age, he chose out
three hundred whom he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ii_15" id="PageIII_ii_15">[15-21]</a></span> knew to be of good birth and possessed of
valour beyond their years, and told them secretly that he was about to
make a present of them to certain of the patricians in Rome,
pretending that they were slaves. And he instructed them that, as soon
as they got inside the houses of those men, they should display much
gentleness and moderation and serve them eagerly in whatever tasks
should be laid upon them by their owners; and he further directed them
that not long afterwards, on an appointed day at about midday, when
all those who were to be their masters would most likely be already
asleep after their meal, they should all come to the gate called
Salarian and with a sudden rush kill the guards, who would have no
previous knowledge of the plot, and open the gates as quickly as
possible. After giving these orders to the youths, Alaric straightway
sent ambassadors to the members of the senate, stating that he admired
them for their loyalty toward their emperor, and that he would trouble
them no longer, because of their valour and faithfulness, with which
it was plain that they were endowed to a remarkable degree, and in
order that tokens of himself might be preserved among men both noble
and brave, he wished to present each one of them with some domestics.
After making this declaration and sending the youths not long
afterwards, he commanded the barbarians to make preparations for the
departure, and he let this be known to the Romans. And they heard his
words gladly, and receiving the gifts began to be exceedingly happy,
since they were completely ignorant of the plot of the barbarian. For
the youths, by being unusually obedient to their owners, averted
suspicion, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ii_21" id="PageIII_ii_21">[21-26]</a></span> the camp some were already seen moving from
their positions and raising the siege, while it seemed that the others
were just on the point of doing the very same thing. But when the
appointed day had come, Alaric armed his whole force for the attack
and was holding them in readiness close by the Salarian Gate; for it
happened that he had encamped there at the beginning of the
siege.<span class="sidenote">Aug. 24, 410 A.D.</span>And all the youths at the time of the day agreed upon came to this
gate, and, assailing the guards suddenly, put them to death; then they
opened the gates and received Alaric and the army into the city at
their leisure. And they set fire to the houses which were next to the
gate, among which was also the house of Sallust, who in ancient times
wrote the history of the Romans, and the greater part of this house
has stood half-burned up to my time; and after plundering the whole
city and destroying the most of the Romans, they moved on. At that
time they say that the Emperor Honorius in Ravenna received the
message from one of the eunuchs, evidently a keeper of the poultry,
that Rome had perished. And he cried out and said, "And yet it has
just eaten from my hands!" For he had a very large cock, Rome by name;
and the eunuch comprehending his words said that it was the city of
Rome which had perished at the hands of Alaric, and the emperor with a
sigh of relief answered quickly: "But I, my good fellow, thought that
my fowl Rome had perished." So great, they say, was the folly with
which this emperor was possessed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ii_27" id="PageIII_ii_27">[27-32]</a></span>
<p>But some say that Rome was not
captured in this way by Alaric, but that Proba, a woman of very
unusual eminence in wealth and in fame among the Roman senatorial
class, felt pity for the Romans who were being destroyed by hunger and
the other suffering they endured; for they were already even tasting
each other's flesh; and seeing that every good hope had left them,
since both the river and the harbour were held by the enemy, she
commanded her domestics, they say, to open the gates by night.
</p>
<p>Now when Alaric was about to depart from Rome, he declared Attalus,
one of their nobles, emperor of the Romans, investing him with the
diadem and the purple and whatever else pertains to the imperial
dignity. And he did this with the intention of removing Honorius from
his throne and of giving over the whole power in the West to Attalus.
With such a purpose, then, both Attalus and Alaric were going with a
great army against Ravenna. But this Attalus was neither able to think
wisely himself, nor to be persuaded by one who had wisdom to offer. So
while Alaric did not by any means approve the plan, Attalus sent
commanders to Libya without an army. Thus, then, were these things
going on.</p>
<span class="sidenote">407 A.D.</span>

<p>And the island of Britain revolted from the Romans, and the soldiers
there chose as their king Constantinus, a man of no mean station. And
he straightway gathered a fleet of ships and a formidable army and
invaded both Spain and Gaul with a great force, thinking to enslave
these countries. But Honorius was holding ships in readiness and
waiting to see what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ii_32" id="PageIII_ii_32">[32-39]</a></span> would happen in Libya, in order that, if
those sent by Attalus were repulsed, he might himself sail for Libya
and keep some portion of his own kingdom, while if matters there
should go against him, he might reach Theodosius and remain with him.
<span class="sidenote">408-450 A.D.</span>
For Arcadius had already died long before, and his son Theodosius,
still a very young child,<a name="FNanchor_18_III" id="FNanchor_18_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_III" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> held the power of the East. But while
Honorius was thus anxiously awaiting the outcome of these events and
tossed amid the billows of uncertain fortune, it so chanced that some
wonderful pieces of good fortune befell him. For God is accustomed to
succour those who are neither clever nor able to devise anything of
themselves, and to lend them assistance, if they be not wicked, when
they are in the last extremity of despair; such a thing, indeed,
befell this emperor. For it was suddenly reported from Libya that the
commanders of Attalus had been destroyed, and that a host of ships was
at hand from Byzantium with a very great number of soldiers who had
come to assist him, though he had not expected them, and that Alaric,
having quarrelled with Attalus, had stripped him of the emperor's garb
and was now keeping him under guard in the position of a private
citizen.
<span class="sidenote">411 A.D.</span>
And afterwards Alaric died of disease, and the army of the Visigoths
under the leadership of Adaulphus proceeded into Gaul, and
Constantinus, defeated in battle, died with his sons. However the
Romans never succeeded in recovering Britain, but it remained from
that time on under tyrants. And the Goths, after making the crossing
of the Ister, at first occupied Pannonia, but afterwards, since the
emperor gave them the right, they inhabited the country of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ii_39" id="PageIII_ii_39">[39-4]</a></span>
Thrace. And after spending no great time there they conquered the
West. But this will be told in the narrative concerning the Goths.
</p><br />
<p>III
</p>
<p>Now the Vandals dwelling about the Maeotic Lake, since they were
pressed by hunger, moved to the country of the Germans, who are now
called Franks, and the river Rhine, associating with themselves the
Alani, a Gothic people. Then from there, under the leadership of
Godigisclus, they moved and settled in Spain, which is the first land
of the Roman empire on the side of the ocean. At that time Honorius
made an agreement with Godigisclus that they should settle there on
condition that it should not be to the detriment of the country. But
there was a law among the Romans, that if any persons should fail to
keep their property in their own possession, and if, meanwhile, a time
amounting to thirty years should pass, that these persons should
thenceforth not be entitled to proceed against those who had forced
them out, but they were excluded by demurrer<a name="FNanchor_19_III" id="FNanchor_19_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_III" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> from access to the
court; and in view of this he established a law that whatever time
should be spent by the Vandals in the Roman domain should not by any
means be counted toward this thirty-year demurrer.
<span class="sidenote">Aug. 27, 423 A.D.</span>
And Honorius himself, when the West had been driven by him to this
pass, died of disease.
Now before this, as it happened, the royal power had been shared
by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iii_4" id="PageIII_iii_4">[4-9]</a></span>
Honorius with Constantius, the husband of Placidia, the sister of
Arcadius and Honorius; <span class="sidenote">421 A.D.</span>but he lived to exercise the power only a few
days, and then, becoming seriously ill, he died while Honorius was
still living, having never succeeded in saying or in doing anything
worth recounting; for the time was not sufficient during which he
lived in possession of the royal power. Now a son of this Constantius,
Valentinian, a child just weaned, was being reared in the palace of
Theodosius, but the members of the imperial court in Rome chose one of
the soldiers there, John by name, as emperor.
This man was both gentle and well-endowed with sagacity and thoroughly
capable of valorous deeds. At any rate he held the tyranny five
years<a name="FNanchor_20_III" id="FNanchor_20_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_III" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and directed it with moderation, and he neither gave ear to
slanderers nor did he do any unjust murder, willingly at least, nor
did he set his hand to robbing men of money; but he did not prove able
to do anything at all against the barbarians, since his relations with
Byzantium were hostile. Against this John, Theodosius, the son of
Arcadius, sent a great army and Aspar and Ardaburius, the son of
Aspar, as generals, and wrested from him the tyranny and gave over the
royal power to Valentinian, who was still a child. And Valentinian
took John alive, and he brought him out in the hippodrome of Aquileia
with one of his hands cut off and caused him to ride in state on an
ass, and then after he had suffered much ill treatment from the
stage-performers there, both in word and in deed, he put him to death.
<span class="sidenote">426 A.D.</span>
Thus Valentinian took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iii_9" id="PageIII_iii_9">[9-16]</a></span> over the power of the West. But Placidia,
his mother, had reared this emperor and educated him in an altogether
effeminate manner, and in consequence he was filled with wickedness
from childhood. For he associated mostly with sorcerers and those who
busy themselves with the stars, and, being an extraordinarily zealous
pursuer of love affairs with other men's wives, he conducted himself
in a most indecent manner, although he was married to a woman of
exceptional beauty.
<span class="sidenote">455 A.D.</span>
And not only was this true, but he also failed to recover for the
empire anything of what had been wrested from it before, and he both
lost Libya in addition to the territory previously lost and was
himself destroyed. And when he perished, it fell to the lot of his
wife and his children to become captives. Now the disaster in Libya
came about as follows.
</p>
<p>There were two Roman generals, Aetius and Boniface, especially valiant
men and in experience of many wars inferior to none of that time at
least. These two came to be at variance in regard to matters of state,
but they attained to such a degree of highmindedness and excellence in
every respect that if one should call either of them "the last of the
Romans" he would not err, so true was it that all the excellent
qualities of the Romans were summed up in these two men. One of these,
Boniface, was appointed by Placidia general of all Libya. Now this was
not in accord with the wishes of Aetius, but he by no means disclosed
the fact that it did not please him. For their hostility had not as
yet come to light, but was concealed behind the countenance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iii_16" id="PageIII_iii_16">[16-23]</a></span> of
each. But when Boniface had got out of the way, Aetius slandered him
to Placidia, saying that he was setting up a tyranny and had robbed
her and the emperor of all Libya, and he said that it was very easy
for her to find out the truth; for if she should summon Boniface to
Rome, he would never come. And when the woman heard this, Aetius
seemed to her to speak well and she acted accordingly. But Aetius,
anticipating her, wrote to Boniface secretly that the mother of the
emperor was plotting against him and wished to put him out of the way.
And he predicted to him that there would be convincing proof of the
plot; for he would be summoned very shortly for no reason at all. Such
was the announcement of the letter. And Boniface did not disregard the
message, for as soon as those arrived who were summoning him to the
emperor, he refused to give heed to the emperor and his mother,
disclosing to no one the warning of Aetius. So when Placidia heard
this, she thought that Aetius was exceedingly well-disposed towards
the emperor's cause and took under consideration the question of
Boniface. But Boniface, since it did not seem to him that he was able
to array himself against the emperor, and since if he returned to Rome
there was clearly no safety for him, began to lay plans so that, if
possible, he might have a defensive alliance with the Vandals, who, as
previously stated, had established themselves in Spain not far from
Libya. There Godigisclus had died and the royal power had fallen to
his sons, Gontharis, who was born to him from his wedded wife, and
Gizeric,<a name="FNanchor_21_III" id="FNanchor_21_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_III" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of illegitimate birth. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iii_23" id="PageIII_iii_23">[23-29]</a></span> former was still a
child and not of very energetic temper, while Gizeric had been
excellently trained in warfare, and was the cleverest of all men.
Boniface accordingly sent to Spain those who were his own most
intimate friends and gained the adherence of each of the sons of
Godigisclus on terms of complete equality, it being agreed that each
one of the three, holding a third part of Libya, should rule over his
own subjects; but if a foe should come against any one of them to make
war, that they should in common ward off the aggressors. On the basis
of this agreement the Vandals crossed the strait at Gadira and came
into Libya, and the Visigoths in later times settled in Spain. But in
Rome the friends of Boniface, remembering the character of the man and
considering how strange his action was, were greatly astonished to
think that Boniface was setting up a tyranny, and some of them at the
order of Placidia went to Carthage. There they met Boniface, and saw
the letter of Aetius, and after hearing the whole story they returned
to Rome as quickly as they could and reported to Placidia how Boniface
stood in relation to her. And though the woman was dumbfounded, she
did nothing unpleasant to Aetius nor did she upbraid him for what he
had done to the emperor's house, for he himself wielded great power
and the affairs of the empire were already in an evil plight; but she
disclosed to the friends of Boniface the advice Aetius had given, and,
offering oaths and pledges of safety, entreated them to persuade the
man, if they could, to return to his fatherland and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iii_29" id="PageIII_iii_29">[29-36]</a></span> not to
permit the empire of the Romans to lie under the hand of barbarians.
And when Boniface heard this, he repented of his act and of his
agreement with the barbarians, and he besought them incessantly,
promising them everything, to remove from Libya. But since they did
not receive his words with favour, but considered that they were being
insulted, he was compelled to fight with them, and being defeated in
the battle, he retired to Hippo<a name="FNanchor_22_III" id="FNanchor_22_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_III" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Regius, a strong city in the
portion of Numidia that is on the sea. There the Vandals made camp
under the leadership of Gizeric and began a siege; for Gontharis had
already died. And they say that he perished at the hand of his
brother. The Vandals, however, do not agree with those who make this
statement, but say that Gontharis' was captured in battle by Germans
in Spain and impaled, and that Gizeric was already sole ruler when he
led the Vandals into Libya. This, indeed, I have heard from the
Vandals, stated in this way. But after much time had passed by, since
they were unable to secure Hippo Regius either by force or by
surrender, and since at the same time they were being pressed by
hunger, they raised the siege. And a little later Boniface and the
Romans in Libya, since a numerous army had come from both Rome and
Byzantium and Aspar with them as general, decided to renew the
struggle, and a fierce battle was fought in which they were badly
beaten by the enemy, and they made haste to flee as each one could.
And Aspar betook himself homeward, and Boniface, coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iii_36" id="PageIII_iii_36">[36-8]</a></span> before
Placidia, acquitted himself of the suspicion, showing that it had
arisen against him for no true cause.
</p><br />
<p>IV
</p>
<p>So the Vandals, having wrested Libya from the Romans in this way, made
it their own. And those of the enemy whom they took alive they reduced
to slavery and held under guard. Among these happened to be Marcian,
who later upon the death of Theodosius assumed the imperial power. At
that time, however, Gizeric commanded that the captives be brought
into the king's courtyard, in order that it might be possible for him,
by looking at them, to know what master each of them might serve
without degradation. And when they were gathered under the open sky,
about midday, the season being summer, they were distressed by the sun
and sat down. And somewhere or other among them Marcian, quite
neglected, was sleeping. Then an eagle flew over him spreading out his
wings, as they say, and always remaining in the same place in the air
he cast a shadow over Marcian alone. And Gizeric, upon seeing from the
upper storey what was happening, since he was an exceedingly
discerning person, suspected that the thing was a divine
manifestation, and summoning the man enquired of him who he might be.
And he replied that he was a confidential adviser of Aspar; such a
person the Romans call a "domesticus" in their own tongue. And when
Gizeric heard this and considered first the meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iv_8" id="PageIII_iv_8">[8-13]</a></span> of the
bird's action, and then remembered how great power Aspar exercised in
Byzantium, it became evident to him that the man was being led to
royal power. He therefore by no means deemed it right to kill him,
reasoning that, if he should remove him from the world, it would be
very clear that the thing which the bird had done was nothing (for he
would not honour with his shadow a king who was about to die
straightway), and he felt, too, that he would be killing him for no
good cause; and if, on the other hand, it was fated that in later
times the man should become king, it would never be within his power
to inflict death upon him; for that which has been decided upon by God
could never be prevented by a man's decision. But he bound Marcian by
oaths that, if it should be in his power, he would never take up arms
against the Vandals at least. Thus, then, Marcian was released and
came to Byzantium, and when at a later time Theodosius died he
received the empire.<span class="sidenote">450 A.D.</span>

And in all other respects he proved himself a
good emperor, but he paid no attention at all to affairs in Libya. But
this happened in later times.
</p>
<p>At that time Gizeric, after conquering Aspar and Boniface in battle,
displayed a foresight worth recounting, whereby he made his good
fortune most thoroughly secure. For fearing lest, if once again an
army should come against him from both Rome and Byzantium, the Vandals
might not be able to use the same strength and enjoy the same fortune,
(since human affairs are wont to be overturned by Heaven and to fail
by reason of the weakness of men's bodies), he was not lifted up by
the good fortune he had enjoyed, but rather became moderate because of
what he feared, and so he made a treaty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iv_13" id="PageIII_iv_13">[13-20]</a></span> with the Emperor
Valentinian providing that each year he should pay to the emperor
tribute from Libya, and he delivered over one of his sons, Honoric, as
a hostage to make this agreement binding. So Gizeric both showed
himself a brave man in the battle and guarded the victory as securely
as possible, and, since the friendship between the two peoples
increased greatly, he received back his son Honoric. And at Rome
Placidia had died before this time, and after her, Valentinian, her
son, also died, having no male offspring, but two daughters had been
born to him from Eudoxia, the child of Theodosius. And I shall now
relate in what manner Valentinian died.
</p>
<p>There was a certain Maximus, a Roman senator, of the house of that
Maximus<a name="FNanchor_23_III" id="FNanchor_23_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_III" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> who, while usurping the imperial power, was overthrown by
the elder Theodosius and put to death, and on whose account also the
Romans celebrate the annual festival named from the defeat of Maximus.
This younger Maximus was married to a woman discreet in her ways and
exceedingly famous for her beauty. For this reason a desire came over
Valentinian to have her to wife. And since it was impossible, much as
he wished it, to meet her, he plotted an unholy deed and carried it to
fulfilment. For he summoned Maximus to the palace and sat down with
him to a game of draughts, and a certain sum was set as a penalty for
the loser; and the emperor won in this game, and receiving Maximus'
ring as a pledge for the agreed amount, he sent it to his house,
instructing the messenger to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iv_20" id="PageIII_iv_20">[20-28]</a></span> tell the wife of Maximus that her
husband bade her come as quickly as possible to the palace to salute
the queen Eudoxia. And she, judging by the ring that the message was
from Maximus, entered her litter and was conveyed to the emperor's
court. And she was received by those who had been assigned this
service by the emperor, and led into a certain room far removed from
the women's apartments, where Valentinian met her and forced her, much
against her will. And she, after the outrage, went to her husband's
house weeping and feeling the deepest possible grief because of her
misfortune, and she cast many curses upon Maximus as having provided
the cause for what had been done. Maximus, accordingly, became
exceedingly aggrieved at that which had come to pass, and straightway
entered into a conspiracy against the emperor; but when he saw that
Aetius was exceedingly powerful, for he had recently conquered Attila,
who had invaded the Roman domain with a great army of Massagetae and
the other Scythians, the thought occurred to him that Aetius would be
in the way of his undertaking. And upon considering this matter, it
seemed to him that it was the better course to put Aetius out of the
way first, paying no heed to the fact that the whole hope of the
Romans centred in him. And since the eunuchs who were in attendance
upon the emperor were well-disposed toward him, he persuaded the
emperor by their devices that Aetius was setting on foot a revolution.
And Valentinian, judging by nothing else than the power and valour of
Aetius that the report was true, put the man to death.
<span class="sidenote">Sept.21, 454 A.D.</span>
Whereupon a certain Roman made himself famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iv_28" id="PageIII_iv_28">[28-33]</a></span> by a saying which
he uttered. For when the emperor enquired of him whether he had done
well in putting Aetius to death, he replied saying that, as to this
matter, he was not able to know whether he had done well or perhaps
otherwise, but one thing he understood exceedingly well, that he had
cut off his own right hand with the other.
</p>
<p>So after the death of Aetius,<a name="FNanchor_24_III" id="FNanchor_24_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_III" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Attila, since no one was a match for
him, plundered all Europe with no trouble and made both emperors
subservient and tributary to himself. For tribute money was sent to
him every year by the emperors. At that time, while Attila was
besieging Aquileia, a city of great size and exceedingly populous
situated near the sea and above the Ionian Gulf, they say that the
following good fortune befell him. For they tell the story that, when
he was able to capture the place neither by force nor by any other
means, he gave up the siege in despair, since it had already lasted a
long time, and commanded the whole army without any delay to make
their preparations for the departure, in order that on the morrow all
might move from there at sunrise. And the following day about sunrise,
the barbarians had raised the siege and were already beginning the
departure, when a single male stork which had a nest on a certain
tower of the city wall and was rearing his nestlings there suddenly
rose and left the place with his young. And the father stork was
flying, but the little storks, since they were not yet quite ready to
fly, were at times sharing their father's flight and at times
riding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iv_33" id="PageIII_iv_33">[33-38]</a></span> upon his back, and thus they flew off and went far away
from the city. And when Attila saw this (for he was most clever at
comprehending and interpreting all things), he commanded the army,
they say, to remain still in the same place, adding that the bird
would never have gone flying off at random from there with his
nestlings, unless he was prophesying that some evil would come to the
place at no distant time. Thus, they say, the army of the barbarians
settled down to the siege once more, and not long after that a portion
of the wall&mdash;the very part which held the nest of that bird&mdash;for no
apparent reason suddenly fell down, and it became possible for the
enemy to enter the city at that point, and thus Aquileia was captured
by storm. Such is the story touching Aquileia.
</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">455 A.D.</span>Later on Maximus slew the emperor with no trouble and secured the
tyranny, and he married Eudoxia by force. For the wife to whom he had
been wedded had died not long before. And on one occasion in private
he made the statement to Eudoxia that it was all for the sake of her
love that he had carried out all that he had done. And since she felt
a repulsion for Maximus even before that time, and had been desirous
of exacting vengeance from him for the wrong done Valentinian, his
words made her swell with rage still more against him, and led her on
to carry out her plot, since she had heard Maximus say that on account
of her the misfortune had befallen her husband. And as soon as day
came, she sent to Carthage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_iv_38" id="PageIII_iv_38">[38-4]</a></span> entreating Gizeric to avenge
Valentinian, who had been destroyed by an unholy man, in a manner
unworthy both of himself and of his imperial station, and to deliver
her, since she was suffering unholy treatment at the hand of the
tyrant. And she impressed it upon Gizeric that, since he was a friend
and ally and so great a calamity had befallen the imperial house, it
was not a holy thing to fail to become an avenger. For from Byzantium
she thought no vengeance would come, since Theodosius had already<span class="sidenote">Mar. 17, 455.A.D.</span>
departed from the world and Marcian had taken over the empire.
</p><br />
<p>V
</p>
<p>And Gizeric, for no other reason than that he suspected that much
money would come to him, set sail for Italy with a great fleet. And
going up to Rome, since no one stood in his way, he took possession of
the palace. Now while Maximus was trying to flee, the Romans threw
stones at him and killed him, and they cut off his head and each of
his other members and divided them among themselves. But Gizeric took
Eudoxia captive, together with Eudocia and Placidia, the children of
herself and Valentinian, and placing an exceedingly great amount of
gold and other imperial treasure<a name="FNanchor_25_III" id="FNanchor_25_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_III" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> in his ships sailed to Carthage,
having spared neither bronze nor anything else whatsoever in the
palace. He plundered also the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_v_4" id="PageIII_v_4">[4-9]</a></span>
tore off half of the roof. Now this roof was of bronze of the finest
quality, and since gold was laid over it exceedingly thick, it shone
as a magnificent and wonderful spectacle.<a name="FNanchor_26_III" id="FNanchor_26_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_III" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But of the ships with
Gizeric, one, which was bearing the statues, was lost, they say, but
with all the others the Vandals reached port in the harbour of
Carthage. Gizeric then married Eudocia to Honoric, the elder of his
sons; but the other of the two women, being the wife of Olybrius, a
most distinguished man in the Roman senate, he sent to Byzantium
together with her mother, Eudoxia, at the request of the emperor. Now
the power of the East had by now fallen to Leon, who had been set in
this position by Aspar, since Marcian had already passed from the
world.<span class="sidenote">457. A.D.</span>
</p>
<p>Afterwards Gizeric devised the following scheme. He tore down the
walls of all the cities in Libya except Carthage, so that neither the
Libyans themselves, espousing the cause of the Romans, might have a
strong base from which to begin a rebellion, nor those sent by the
emperor have any ground for hoping to capture a city and by
establishing a garrison in it to make trouble for the Vandals. Now at
that time it seemed that he had counselled well and had ensured
prosperity for the Vandals in the safest possible manner; but in later
times when these cities, being without walls, were captured by
Belisarius all the more easily and with less exertion, Gizeric was
then condemned to suffer much ridicule,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_v_9" id="PageIII_v_9">[9-17]</a></span> and that which for the
time he considered wise counsel turned out for him to be folly. For as
fortunes change, men are always accustomed to change with them their
judgments regarding what has been planned in the past. And among the
Libyans all who happened to be men of note and conspicuous for their
wealth he handed over as slaves, together with their estates and all
their money, to his sons Honoric and Genzon. For Theodorus, the
youngest son, had died already, being altogether without offspring,
either male or female. And he robbed the rest of the Libyans of their
estates, which were both very numerous and excellent, and distributed
them among the nation of the Vandals, and as a result of this these
lands have been called "Vandals' estates" up to the present time. And
it fell to the lot of those who had formerly possessed these lands to
be in extreme poverty and to be at the same time free men; and they
had the privilege of going away wheresoever they wished. And Gizeric
commanded that all the lands which he had given over to his sons and
to the other Vandals should not be subject to any kind of taxation.
But as much of the land as did not seem to him good he allowed to
remain in the hands of the former owners, but assessed so large a sum
to be paid on this land for taxes to the government that nothing
whatever remained to those who retained their farms. And many of them
were constantly being sent into exile or killed. For charges were
brought against them of many sorts, and heavy ones too; but one charge
seemed to be the greatest of all, that a man, having money of his own,
was hiding it. Thus the Libyans were visited with every form of
misfortune.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_v_18" id="PageIII_v_18">[18-25]</a></span>
</p>
<p>The Vandals and the Alani he arranged in companies, appointing over
them no less than eighty captains, whom he called "chiliarchs,"<a name="FNanchor_27_III" id="FNanchor_27_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_III" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
making it appear that his host of fighting men in active service
amounted to eighty thousand. And yet the number of the Vandals and
Alani was said in former times, at least, to amount to no more than
fifty thousand men. However, after that time by their natural increase
among themselves and by associating other barbarians with them they
came to be an exceedingly numerous people. But the names of the Alani
and all the other barbarians, except the Moors, were united in the
name of Vandals. At that time, after the death of Valentinian, Gizeric
gained the support of the Moors, and every year at the beginning of
spring he made invasions into Sicily and Italy, enslaving some of the
cities, razing others to the ground, and plundering everything; and
when the land had become destitute of men and of money, he invaded the
domain of the emperor of the East. And so he plundered Illyricum and
the most of the Peloponnesus and of the rest of Greece and all the
islands which lie near it. And again he went off to Sicily and Italy,
and kept plundering and pillaging all places in turn. And one day when
he had embarked on his ship in the harbour of Carthage, and the sails
were already being spread, the pilot asked him, they say, against what
men in the world he bade them go. And he in reply said: "Plainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_v_25" id="PageIII_v_25">
[25-4]</a></span>
against those with whom God is angry." Thus without any cause he kept
making invasions wherever chance might lead him.
</p><br />
<p>VI
</p>
<p>And the Emperor Leon, wishing to punish the Vandals because of these
things, was gathering an army against them; and they say that this
army amounted to about one hundred thousand men. And he collected a
fleet of ships from the whole of the eastern Mediterranean, shewing
great generosity to both soldiers and sailors, for he feared lest from
a parsimonious policy some obstacle might arise to hinder him in his
desire to carry out his punishment of the barbarians. Therefore, they
say, thirteen hundred centenaria<a name="FNanchor_28_III" id="FNanchor_28_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_III" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> were expended by him to no
purpose. But since it was not fated that the Vandals should be
destroyed by this expedition, he made Basiliscus commander-in-chief,
the brother of his wife Berine, a man who was extraordinarily desirous
of the royal power, which he hoped would come to him without a
struggle if he won the friendship of Aspar. For Aspar himself, being
an adherent of the Arian faith, and having no intention of changing it
for another, was unable to enter upon the imperial office, but he was
easily strong enough to establish another in it, and it already seemed
likely that he would plot against the Emperor Leon, who had given him
offence. So they say that since Aspar was then fearful lest, if the
Vandals were defeated, Leon should establish his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_vi_4" id="PageIII_vi_4">[4-9]</a></span> power most
securely, he repeatedly urged upon Basiliscus that he should spare the
Vandals and Gizeric.
</p>
<p>Now before this time Leon had already appointed and sent Anthemius, as
Emperor of the West, a man of the senate of great wealth and high
birth, in order that he might assist him in the Vandalic war. And yet
Gizeric kept asking and earnestly entreating that the imperial power
be given to Olybrius, who was married to Placidia, the daughter of
Valentinian, and on account of his relationship<a name="FNanchor_29_III" id="FNanchor_29_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_III" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> well-disposed
toward him, and when he failed in this he was still more angry and
kept plundering the whole land of the emperor. Now there was in
Dalmatia a certain Marcellianus, one of the acquaintances of Aetius
and a man of repute, who, after Aetius had died in the manner told
above,<a name="FNanchor_30_III" id="FNanchor_30_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_III" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> no longer deigned to yield obedience to the emperor, but
beginning a revolution and detaching all the others from allegiance,
held the power of Dalmatia himself, since no one dared encounter him.
But the Emperor Leon at that time won over this Marcellianus by very
careful wheedling, and bade him go to the island of Sardinia, which
was then subject to the Vandals. And he drove out the Vandals and
gained possession of it with no great difficulty. And Heracleius was
sent from Byzantium to Tripolis in Libya, and after conquering the
Vandals of that district in battle, he easily captured the cities, and
leaving his ships there, led his army on foot toward Carthage. Such,
then, was the sequence of events which formed the prelude of the
war.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_vi_10" id="PageIII_vi_10">[10-16]</a></span>
</p>
<p>But Basiliscus with his whole fleet put in at a town distant from
Carthage no less than two hundred and eighty stades (now it so
happened that a temple of Hermes had been there from of old, from
which fact the place was named Mercurium; for the Romans call Hermes
"Mercurius"), and if he had not purposely played the coward and
hesitated, but had undertaken to go straight for Carthage, he would
have captured it at the first onset, and he would have reduced the
Vandals to subjection without their even thinking of resistance; so
overcome was Gizeric with awe of Leon as an invincible emperor, when
the report was brought to him that Sardinia and Tripolis had been
captured, and he saw the fleet of Basiliscus to be such as the Romans
were said never to have had before. But, as it was, the general's
hesitation, whether caused by cowardice or treachery, prevented this
success. And Gizeric, profiting by the negligence of Basiliscus, did
as follows. Arming all his subjects in the best way he could, he
filled his ships, but not all, for some he kept in readiness empty,
and they were the ships which sailed most swiftly. And sending envoys
to Basiliscus, he begged him to defer the war for the space of five
days, in order that in the meantime he might take counsel and do those
things which were especially desired by the emperor. They say, too,
that he sent also a great amount of gold without the knowledge of the
army of Basiliscus and thus purchased this armistice. And he did this,
thinking, as actually did happen, that a favouring wind would rise for
him during this time. And Basiliscus, either as doing a favour to
Aspar in accordance with what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_vi_16" id="PageIII_vi_16">[16-22]</a></span> he had promised, or selling the
moment of opportunity for money, or perhaps thinking it the better
course, did as he was requested and remained quietly in the camp,
awaiting the moment favourable to the enemy.
</p>
<p>But the Vandals, as soon as the wind had arisen for them which they
had been expecting during the time they lay at rest, raised their
sails and, taking in tow the boats which, as has been stated above,
they had made ready with no men in them, they sailed against the
enemy. And when they came near, they set fire to the boats which they
were towing, when their sails were bellied by the wind, and let them
go against the Roman fleet. And since there were a great number of
ships there, these boats easily spread fire wherever they struck, and
were themselves readily destroyed together with those with which they
came in contact. And as the fire advanced in this way the Roman fleet
was filled with tumult, as was natural, and with a great din that
rivalled the noise caused by the wind and the roaring of the flames,
as the soldiers together with the sailors shouted orders to one
another and pushed off with their poles the fire-boats and their own
ships as well, which were being destroyed by one another in complete
disorder. And already the Vandals too were at hand ramming and sinking
the ships, and making booty of such of the soldiers as attempted to
escape, and of their arms as well. But there were also some of the
Romans who proved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_vi_22" id="PageIII_vi_22">[22-27]</a></span> themselves brave men in this struggle, and
most of all John, who was a general under Basiliscus and who had no
share whatever in his treason. For a great throng having surrounded
his ship, he stood on the deck, and turning from side to side kept
killing very great numbers of the enemy from there, and when he
perceived that the ship was being captured, he leaped with his whole
equipment of arms from the deck into the sea. And though Genzon, the
son of Gizeric, entreated him earnestly not to do this, offering
pledges and holding out promises of safety, he nevertheless threw
himself into the sea, uttering this one word, that John would never
come under the hands of dogs.</p>
<span class="sidenote">471 A.D.</span>

<p>So this war came to an end, and Heracleius departed for home; for
Marcellianus had been destroyed treacherously by one of his
fellow-officers. And Basiliscus, coming to Byzantium, seated himself
as a suppliant in the sanctuary of Christ the Great God ("Sophia"<a name="FNanchor_31_III" id="FNanchor_31_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_III" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
the temple is called by the men of Byzantium who consider that this
designation is especially appropriate to God), and although, by the
intercession of Berine, the queen, he escaped this danger, he was not
able at that time to reach the throne, the thing for the sake of which
everything had been done by him. For the Emperor Leon not long
afterwards destroyed both Aspar and Ardaburius in the palace, because
he suspected that they were plotting against his life. Thus, then, did
these events take place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_vii_1" id="PageIII_vii_1">[1-7]</a></span>
</p><br />
<p>VII</p>
<span class="sidenote">Aug. 11, 472 A.D.</span>

<p>Now Anthemius, the emperor of the West, died at the hand of his
son-in-law Rhecimer, and Olybrius, succeeding to the throne, a short
time afterward suffered the same fate.
<span class="sidenote">Oct. 10, 472 A.D.</span>
And when Leon also had died in
Byzantium, the imperial office was taken over by the younger Leon, the
son of Zeno and Ariadne, the daughter of Leon, while he was still only
a few days old. And his father having been chosen as partner in the
royal power, the child forthwith passed from the world.
<span class="sidenote">474 A.D.</span>
Majorinus also
deserves mention, who had gained the power of the West before this
time. For this Majorinus, who surpassed in every virtue all who have
ever been emperors of the Romans, did not bear lightly the loss of
Libya, but collected a very considerable army against the Vandals and
came to Liguria, intending himself to lead the army against the enemy.
For Majorinus never showed the least hesitation before any task and
least of all before the dangers of war. But thinking it not
inexpedient for him to investigate first the strength of the Vandals
and the character of Gizeric and to discover how the Moors and Libyans
stood with regard to friendship or hostility toward the Romans, he
decided to trust no eyes other than his own in such a matter.
Accordingly he set out as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_vii_7" id="PageIII_vii_7">[7-13]</a></span> if an envoy from the emperor to
Gizeric, assuming some fictitious name. And fearing lest, by becoming
known, he should himself receive some harm and at the same time
prevent the success of the enterprise, he devised the following
scheme. His hair, which was famous among all men as being so fair as
to resemble pure gold, he anointed with some kind of dye, which was
especially invented for this purpose, and so succeeded completely in
changing it for the time to a dark hue. And when he came before
Gizeric, the barbarian attempted in many ways to terrify him, and in
particular, while treating him with engaging attention, as if a
friend, he brought him into the house where all his weapons were
stored, a numerous and exceedingly noteworthy array. Thereupon they
say that the weapons shook of their own accord and gave forth a sound
of no ordinary or casual sort, and then it seemed to Gizeric that
there had been an earthquake, but when he got outside and made
enquiries concerning the earthquake, since no one else agreed with
him, a great wonder, they say, came over him, but he was not able to
comprehend the meaning of what had happened. So Majorinus, having
accomplished the very things he wished, returned to Liguria, and
leading his army on foot, came to the Pillars of Heracles, purposing
to cross over the strait at that point, and then to march by land from
there against Carthage. And when Gizeric became aware of this, and
perceived that he had been tricked by Majorinus in the matter of the
embassy, he became alarmed and made his preparations for war. And the
Romans, basing their confidence on the valour of Majorinus, already
began to have fair hopes of recovering Libya for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_vii_13" id="PageIII_vii_13">[13-21]</a></span> empire.</p>
<p>
<span class="sidenote">461 A.D.</span>
But meantime Majorinus was attacked by the disease of dysentery and
died, a man who had shewn himself moderate toward his subjects, and an
object of fear to his enemies.
<span class="sidenote">July 24, 474 A.D.</span>
And another emperor, Nepos, upon taking over the empire, and living to
enjoy it only a few days, died of disease, and Glycerius after him
entered into this office and suffered a similar fate.
<span class="sidenote">474-475 A.D.</span>
And after him Augustus assumed the imperial power. There were,
moreover, still other emperors in the West before this time, but
though I know their names well, I shall make no mention of them
whatever. For it so fell out that they lived only a short time after
attaining the office, and as a result of this accomplished nothing
worthy of mention. Such was the course of events in the West.</p>

<p>
But in Byzantium Basiliscus, being no longer able to master his
passion for royal power, made an attempt to usurp the throne, and
succeeded without difficulty, since Zeno, together with his wife,
sought refuge in Isauria, which was his native home. <span class="sidenote"> 471 A.D.</span>And while he was
maintaining his tyranny for a year and eight months he was detested by
practically everyone and in particular by the soldiers of the court on
account of the greatness of his avarice. And Zeno, perceiving this,
collected an army and came against him. And Basiliscus sent an army
under the general Harmatus in order to array himself against Zeno. But
when they had made camp near one another, Harmatus surrendered his
army to Zeno, on the condition that Zeno should appoint as Caesar
Harmatus' son Basiliscus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_vii_21" id="PageIII_vii_21">[21-26]</a></span> who was a very young child, and leave him as successor to the throne upon his death. And Basiliscus,
deserted by all, fled for refuge to the same sanctuary as formerly.
And Acacius, the priest of the city, put him into the hands of Zeno,
charging him with impiety and with having brought great confusion and
many innovations into the Christian doctrine, having inclined toward
the heresy of Eutyches. And this was so. And after Zeno had thus taken
over the empire a second time, he carried out his pledge to Harmatus
formally by appointing his son Basiliscus Caesar, but not long
afterwards he both stripped him of the office and put Harmatus to
death. And he sent Basiliscus together with his children and his wife
into Cappadocia in the winter season, commanding that they should be
destitute of food and clothes and every kind of care. And there, being
hard pressed by both cold and hunger, they took refuge in one
another's arms, and embracing their loved ones, perished. And this
punishment overtook Basiliscus for the policy he had pursued. These
things, however, happened in later times.</p>
<p>
But at that time Gizeric was plundering the whole Roman domain just as
much as before, if not more, circumventing his enemy by craft and
driving them out of their possessions by force, as has been previously
said, and he continued to do so until the emperor Zeno came to an
agreement with him and an endless peace was established between them,
by which it was provided that the Vandals should never in all time
perform any hostile act against the Romans nor suffer such a thing at
their hands. And this peace was preserved by Zeno himself and <span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_vii_26" id="PageIII_vii_26">[26-4]</a></span>also by his successor in the empire, Anastasius And it remained in
force until the time of the emperor Justinus.
But Justinian, who was the nephew of Justinus, succeeded him in the
imperial power, and it was in the reign of this Justinian that the war
with which we are concerned came to pass, in the manner which will be
told in the following narrative.
<span class="sidenote"> 477 A.D.</span>Gizeric, after living on a short
time, died at an advanced age, having made a will in which he
enjoined many things upon the Vandals and in particular that the royal
power among them should always fall to that one who should be the
first in years among all the male offspring descended from Gizeric
himself. So Gizeric, having ruled over the Vandals thirty-nine years
from the time when he captured Carthage, died, as I have said.</p>
<p>
VIII</p>
<p>
And Honoric, the eldest of his sons, succeeded to the throne, Genzon
having already departed from the world. During the time when this
Honoric ruled the Vandals they had no war against anyone at all,
except the Moors. For through fear of Gizeric the Moors had remained
quiet before that time, but as soon as he was out of their way they
both did much harm to the Vandals and suffered the same themselves.
And Honoric shewed himself the most cruel and unjust of all men toward
the Christians in Libya. For he forced them to change over to the
Arian faith, and as many as he found not readily yielding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_viii_4" id="PageIII_viii_4">[4-9]</a></span>
 to him
he burned, or destroyed by other forms of death; and he also cut off
the tongues of many from the very throat, who even up to my time were
going about in Byzantium having their speech uninjured, and perceiving
not the least effect from this punishment; but two of these, since
they saw fit to go in to harlots, were thenceforth no longer able to
speak. And after ruling over the Vandals eight years he died of
disease; and by that time the Moors dwelling on
Mt. Aurasium<a name="FNanchor_32_III" id="FNanchor_32_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_III" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
 had
revolted from the Vandals and were independent (this Aurasium is a
mountain of Numidia, about thirteen days' journey distant from
Carthage and fronting the south); and indeed they never came under the
Vandals again, since the latter were unable to carry on a war against
Moors on a mountain difficult of access and exceedingly steep.</p>
<p>
After the death of Honoric the rule of the Vandals fell to
Gundamundus, the son of Genzon, the son of Gizeric.

<span class="sidenote"> 485 A.D.</span>
For he, in point of years, was the first of the offspring of
Gizeric. This Gundamundus fought against the Moors in numerous
encounters, and after subjecting the Christians to still greater
suffering, he died of disease, being now at about the middle of the
twelfth year of his reign.
<span class="sidenote"> 490 A.D.</span>
And his brother Trasamundus took over the kingdom, a man well-favoured
in appearance and especially gifted with discretion and
highmindedness. However he continued to force the Christians to change
their ancestral faith, not by torturing their bodies as his
predecessors had done,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_viii_9" id="PageIII_viii_9">[9-15]</a></span>
but by seeking to win them with honours and
offices and presenting them with great sums of money; and in the case
of those who would not be persuaded, he pretended he had not the least
knowledge of what manner of men
they were.<a name="FNanchor_33_III" id="FNanchor_33_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_III" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
 And if he caught any
guilty of great crimes which they had committed either by accident or
deliberate intent, he would offer such men, as a reward for changing
their faith, that they should not be punished for their offences. And
when his wife died without becoming the mother of either male or
female offspring, wishing to establish the kingdom as securely as
possible, he sent to Theoderic, the king of the Goths, asking him to
give him his sister Amalafrida to wife, for her husband had just died.
And Theoderic sent him not only his sister but also a thousand of the
notable Goths as a bodyguard, who were followed by a host of
attendants amounting to about five thousand fighting men. And
Theoderic also presented his sister with one of the promontories of
Sicily, which are three in number,&mdash;the one which they call
Lilybaeum,&mdash;and as a result of this Trasamundus was accounted the
strongest and most powerful of all those who had ruled over the
Vandals. He became also a very special friend of the emperor
Anastasius. It was during the reign of Trasamundus that it came about
that the Vandals suffered a disaster at the hands of the Moors such as
had never befallen them before that time.</p>
<p>
There was a certain Cabaon ruling over the Moors of Tripolis, a man
experienced in many wars and exceedingly shrewd. This Cabaon, upon
learning that the Vandals were marching against him, did as
follows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_viii_15" id="PageIII_viii_15">[15-20]</a></span>

First of all he issued orders to his subjects to abstain from
all injustice and from all foods tending towards luxury and most of
all from association with women; and setting up two palisaded
enclosures, he encamped himself with all the men in one, and in the
other he shut the women, and he threatened that death would be the
penalty if anyone should go to the women's palisade. And after this he
sent spies to Carthage with the following instructions: whenever the
Vandals in going forth on the expedition should offer insult to any
temple which the Christians reverence, they were to look on and see
what took place; and when the Vandals had passed the place, they were
to do the opposite of everything which the Vandals had done to the
sanctuary before their departure. And they say that he added this
also, that he was ignorant of the God whom the Christians worshipped,
but it was probable that if He was powerful, as He was said to be, He
should wreak vengeance upon those who insulted Him and defend those
who honoured Him. So the spies came to Carthage and waited quietly,
observing the preparation of the Vandals; but when the army set out on
the march to Tripolis, they followed, clothing themselves in humble
garb. And the Vandals, upon making camp the first day, led their
horses and their other animals into the temples of the Christians, and
sparing no insult, they acted with all the unrestrained lawlessness
natural to them, beating as many priests as they caught and lashing
them with many blows over the back and commanding them to render such
service to the Vandals as they were accustomed to assign to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_viii_20" id="PageIII_viii_20">[20-27]</a></span>
most dishonoured of their domestics. And as soon as they had departed
from there, the spies of Cabaon did as they had been directed to do;
for they straightway cleansed the sanctuaries and took away with great
care the filth and whatever other unholy thing lay in them, and they
lighted all the lamps and bowed down before the priests with great
reverence and saluted them with all friendliness; and after giving
pieces of silver to the poor who sat about these sanctuaries, they
then followed after the army of the Vandals. And from then on along
the whole route the Vandals continued to commit the same offences and
the spies to render the same service. And when they were coming near
the Moors, the spies anticipated them and reported to Cabaon what had
been done by the Vandals and by themselves to the temples of the
Christians, and that the enemy were somewhere near by. And Cabaon,
upon learning this, arranged for the encounter as follows. He marked
off a circle in the plain where he was about to make his palisade, and
placed his camels turned sideways in a circle as a protection for the
camp, making his line fronting the enemy about twelve camels deep.
Then he placed the children and the women and all those who were unfit
for fighting together with their possessions in the middle, while he
commanded the host of fighting men to stand between the feet of those
animals, covering themselves with their shields.<a name="FNanchor_34_III" id="FNanchor_34_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_III" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
 And since the
phalanx of the Moors was of such a sort, the Vandals were at a loss
how to handle the situation; for they were neither good with the
javelin nor with the bow, nor did they know how to go into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_viii_27" id="PageIII_viii_27">[27-3]</a></span>

battle on foot, but they were all horsemen, and used spears and
swords for the most part, so that they were unable to do the enemy any
harm at a distance; and their horses, annoyed at the sight of the
camels, refused absolutely to be driven against the enemy. And since
the Moors, by hurling javelins in great numbers among them from their
safe position, kept killing both their horses and men without
difficulty, because they were a vast throng, they began to flee, and,
when the Moors came out against them, the most of them were destroyed,
while some fell into the hands of the enemy; and an exceedingly small
number from this army returned home. Such was the fortune which
Trasamundus suffered at the hands of the Moors. And he died at a later
time, having ruled over the Moors twenty-seven years.</p>
<br /><p>IX</p>
<p>
<span class="sidenote">523 A.D.</span>
And Ilderic, the son of Honoric, the son of Gizeric, next received the
kingdom, a ruler who was easily approached by his subjects and
altogether gentle, and he shewed himself harsh neither to the
Christians nor to anyone else, but in regard to affairs of war he was
a weakling and did not wish this thing even to come to his ears.

<span class="sidenote"> 523 A.D.</span>

Hoamer, accordingly, his nephew and an able warrior, led the
armies against any with whom the Vandals were at war; he it was whom
they called the Achilles of the Vandals. During the reign of this
Ilderic the Vandals were defeated in Byzacium by the Moors, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ix_3" id="PageIII_ix_3">[3-8]</a></span>

were ruled by Antalas, and it so fell out that they became enemies
instead of allies and friends to Theoderic and the Goths in Italy. For
they put Amalafrida in prison and destroyed all the Goths, charging
them with revolutionary designs against the Vandals and Ilderic.
However, no revenge came from Theoderic, for he considered himself
unable to gather a great fleet and make an expedition into Libya, and
Ilderic was a very particular friend and guest-friend of Justinian,
who had not yet come to the throne, but was administering the
government according to his pleasure; for his uncle Justinus, who was
emperor, was very old and not altogether experienced in matters of
state. And Ilderic and Justinian made large presents of money to each
other.</p>
<p>
Now there was a certain man in the family of Gizeric, Gelimer, the son
of Geilaris, the son of Genzon, the son of Gizeric, who was of such
age as to be second only to Ilderic, and for this reason he was
expected to come into the kingdom very soon. This man was thought to
be the best warrior of his time, but for the rest he was a cunning
fellow and base at heart and well versed in undertaking revolutionary
enterprises and in laying hold upon the money of others. Now this
Gelimer, when he saw the power coming to him, was not able to live in
his accustomed way, but assumed to himself the tasks of a king and
usurped the rule, though it was not yet due him; and since Ilderic in
a spirit of friendliness gave in to him, he was no longer able to
restrain his thoughts, but allying with himself all the noblest of the
Vandals, he persuaded them to wrest the kingdom from Ilderic, as being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ix_8" id="PageIII_ix_8">[8-13]</a></span>
an unwarlike king who had been defeated by the Moors, and as
betraying the power of the Vandals into the hand of the Emperor
Justinus, in order that the kingdom might not come to him, because he
was of the other branch of the family; for he asserted slanderously
that this was the meaning of Ilderic's embassy to Byzantium, and that
he was giving over the empire of the Vandals to Justinus. And they,
being persuaded, carried out this plan.

<span class="sidenote"> 530 A.D.</span>

Thus Gelimer seized the supreme power, and imprisoned Ilderic, after
he had ruled over the Vandals seven years, and also Hoamer and his
brother Euagees.</p>
<p>
 <span class="sidenote"> 527 A.D.</span>

But when Justinian heard these things, having already received the
imperial power, he sent envoys to Gelimer in Libya with the following
letter: "You are not acting in a holy manner nor worthily of the will
of Gizeric, keeping in prison an old man and a kinsman and the king of
the Vandals (if the counsels of Gizeric are to be of effect), and
robbing him of his office by violence, though it would be possible for
you to receive it after a short time in a lawful manner. Do you
therefore do no further wrong and do not exchange the name of king for
the title of tyrant, which comes but a short time earlier. But as for
this man, whose death may be expected at any moment, allow him to bear
in appearance the form of royal power, while you do all the things
which it is proper that a king should do; and wait until you can
receive from time and the law of Gizeric, and from them alone, the
name which belongs to the position. For if you do this, the attitude
of the Almighty will be favourable and at the same time our relations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ix_14" id="PageIII_ix_14">[14-23]</a></span>
with you will be friendly."</p> <p>Such was his message. But Gelimer sent the
envoys away with nothing accomplished, and he blinded Hoamer and also
kept Ilderic and Euagees in closer confinement, charging them with
planning flight to Byzantium. And when this too was heard by the
Emperor Justinian, he sent envoys a second time and wrote as follows:
"We, indeed, supposed that you would never go contrary to our advice
when we wrote you the former letter. But since it pleases you to have
secured possession of the royal power in the manner in which you have
taken and now hold it, get from it whatever Heaven grants. But do you
send to us Ilderic, and Hoamer whom you have blinded, and his brother,
to receive what comfort they can who have been robbed of a kingdom or
of sight; for we shall not let the matter rest if you do not do this.
And I speak thus because we are led by the hope which I had based on
our friendship. And the treaty with Gizeric will not stand as an
obstacle for us. For it is not to make war upon him who has succeeded
to the kingdom of Gizeric that we come, but to avenge Gizeric with all
our power."</p>
<p>
When Gelimer had read this, he replied as follows: "King Gelimer to
the Emperor Justinian. Neither have I taken the office by violence nor
has anything unholy been done by me to my kinsmen. For Ilderic, while
planning a revolution against the house of Gizeric, was dethroned by
the nation of the Vandals; and I was called to the kingdom by my
years, which gave me the preference, according to the law at least.
Now it is well for one to administer the kingly office which belongs
to him and not to make the concerns of others his own. Hence for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_ix_23" id="PageIII_ix_23">[23-2]</a></span>

you also, who have a kingdom, meddling in other's affairs is not just;
and if you break the treaty and come against us, we shall oppose you
with all our power, calling to witness the oaths which were sworn by
Zeno, from whom you have received the kingdom which you hold." The
Emperor Justinian, upon receiving this letter, having been angry with
Gelimer even before then, was still more eager to punish him. And it
seemed to him best to put an end to the Persian war as soon as
possible and then to make an expedition to Libya; and since he was
quick at forming a plan and prompt in carrying out his decisions,
Belisarius, the General of the East, was summoned and came to him
immediately, no announcement having been made to him nor to anyone
else that he was about to lead an army against Libya, but it was given
out that he had been removed from the office which he held. And
straightway the treaty with Persia was made, as has been told in the
preceding narrative.<a name="FNanchor_35_III" id="FNanchor_35_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_III" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
<p>
X</p>
<p>
And when the Emperor Justinian considered that the situation was as
favourable as possible, both as to domestic affairs and as to his
relations with Persia, he took under consideration the situation in
Libya. But when he disclosed to the magistrates that he was gathering
an army against the Vandals and Gelimer, the most of them began
immediately to show hostility to the plan, and they lamented it as a
misfortune, recalling the expedition of the Emperor Leon and the
disaster of Basiliscus, and reciting how many soldiers had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_x_2" id="PageIII_x_2">[2-7]</a></span>
perished and how much money the state had lost. But the men who were
the most sorrowful of all, and who, by reason of their anxiety, felt
the keenest regret, were the pretorian prefect, whom the Romans call
"praetor," and the administrator of the treasury, and all to whom had
been assigned the collection of either public or imperial<a name="FNanchor_36_III" id="FNanchor_36_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_III" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
 taxes,
for they reasoned that while it would be necessary for them to produce
countless sums for the needs of the war, they would be granted neither
pardon in case of failure nor extension of time in which to raise
these sums. And every one of the generals, supposing that he himself
would command the army, was in terror and dread at the greatness of
the danger, if it should be necessary for him, if he were preserved
from the perils of the sea, to encamp in the enemy's land, and, using
his ships as a base, to engage in a struggle against a kingdom both
large and formidable. The soldiers, also, having recently returned
from a long, hard war, and having not yet tasted to the full the
blessings of home, were in despair, both because they were being led
into sea-fighting,&mdash;a thing which they had not learned even from
tradition before then,&mdash;and because they were sent from the eastern
frontier to the West, in order to risk their lives against Vandals and
Moors. But all the rest, as usually happens in a great throng, wished
to be spectators of new adventures while others faced the dangers.</p>
<p>
But as for saying anything to the emperor to prevent the expedition,
no one dared to do this except John the Cappadocian, the pretorian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_x_7" id="PageIII_x_7">[7-13]</a></span>

prefect, a man of the greatest daring and the cleverest of all
men of his time. For this John, while all the others were bewailing in
silence the fortune which was upon them, came before the emperor and
spoke as follows: "O Emperor, the good faith which thou dost shew in
dealing with thy subjects enables us to speak frankly regarding
anything which will be of advantage to thy government, even though
what is said and done may not be agreeable to thee. For thus does thy
wisdom temper thy authority with justice, in that thou dost not
consider that man only as loyal to thy cause who serves thee under any
and all conditions, nor art thou angry with the man who speaks against
thee, but by weighing all things by pure reason alone, thou hast often
shewn that it involves us in no danger to oppose thy purposes. Led by
these considerations, O Emperor, I have come to offer this advice,
knowing that, though I shall give perhaps offence at the moment, if it
so chance, yet in the future the loyalty which I bear you will be made
clear, and that for this I shall be able to shew thee as a witness.
For if, through not hearkening to my words, thou shalt carry out the
war against the Vandals, it will come about, if the struggle is
prolonged for thee, that my advice will win renown. For if thou hast
confidence that thou wilt conquer the enemy, it is not at all
unreasonable that thou shouldst sacrifice the lives of men and expend
a vast amount of treasure, and undergo the difficulties of the
struggle; for victory, coming at the end, covers up all the calamities
of war. But if in reality these things lie on the knees of God, and if
it behoves us, taking example from what has happened in the past, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_x_13" id="PageIII_x_13">[13-20]</a></span>

fear the outcome of war, on what grounds is it not better to
love a state of quiet rather than the dangers of mortal strife? Thou
art purposing to make an expedition against Carthage, to which, if one
goes by land, the journey is one of a hundred and forty days, and if
one goes by water, he is forced to cross the whole open sea and go to
its very end. So that he who brings thee news of what will happen in
the camp must needs reach thee a year after the event. And one might
add that if thou art victorious over thy enemy, thou couldst not take
possession of Libya while Sicily and Italy lie in the hands of others;
and at the same time, if any reverse befall thee, O Emperor, the
treaty having already been broken by thee, thou wilt bring the danger
upon our own land. In fact, putting all in a word, it will not be
possible for thee to reap the fruits of victory, and at the same time
any reversal of fortune will bring harm to what is well established.
It is before an enterprise that wise planning is useful. For when men
have failed, repentance is of no avail, but before disaster comes
there is no danger in altering plans. Therefore it will be of
advantage above all else to make fitting use of the decisive moment."</p>
<p>
Thus spoke John; and the Emperor Justinian, hearkening to his words,
checked his eager desire for the war. But one of the priests whom they
call bishops, who had come from the East, said that he wished to have
a word with the emperor. And when he met Justinian, he said that God
had visited him in a dream, and bidden him go to the emperor and
rebuke him, because, after undertaking the task of protecting the
Christians in Libya from tyrants, he had for no good reason become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_x_20" id="PageIII_x_20">[20-28]</a></span>
afraid. "And yet," He had said, "I will Myself join with him in
waging war and make him lord of Libya." When the emperor heard this,
he was no longer able to restrain his purpose, and he began to collect
the army and the ships, and to make ready supplies of weapons and of
food, and he announced to Belisarius that he should be in readiness,
because he was very soon to act as general in Libya. Meanwhile
Pudentius, one of the natives of Tripolis in Libya, caused this
district to revolt from the Vandals, and sending to the emperor he
begged that he should despatch an army to him; for, he said, he would
with no trouble win the land for the emperor. And Justinian sent him
Tattimuth and an army of no very great size. This force Pudentius
joined with his own troops and, the Vandals being absent, he gained
possession of the land and made it subject to the emperor. And
Gelimer, though wishing to inflict punishment upon Pudentius, found
the following obstacle in his way.</p>
<p>
There was a certain Godas among the slaves of Gelimer, a Goth by
birth, a passionate and energetic fellow possessed of great bodily
strength, but appearing to be well-disposed to the cause of his
master. To this Godas Gelimer entrusted the island of Sardinia, in
order both to guard the island and to pay over the annual tribute. But
he neither could digest the prosperity brought by fortune nor had he
the spirit to endure it, and so he undertook to establish a tyranny,
and he refused to continue the payment of the tribute, and actually
detached the island from the Vandals and held it himself. And when he
perceived that the Emperor Justinian was eager to make war against
Libya and Gelimer, he wrote to him as follows:</p> <p>"It was neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_x_29" id="PageIII_x_29">[29-2]</a></span>
because I yielded to folly nor because I had suffered anything
unpleasant at my master's hands that I turned my thoughts towards
rebellion, but seeing the extreme cruelty of the man both toward his
kinsmen and toward his subjects, I could not, willingly at least, be
reputed to have a share in his inhumanity. For it is better to serve a
just king than a tyrant whose commands are unlawful. But do thou join
with me to assist in this my effort and send soldiers so that I may be
able to ward off my assailants."</p>
<p>
And the emperor, on receiving this letter, was pleased, and he sent
Eulogius as envoy and wrote a letter praising Godas for his wisdom and
his zeal for justice, and he promised an alliance and soldiers and a
general, who would be able to guard the island with him and to assist
him in every other way, so that no trouble should come to him from the
Vandals. But Eulogius, upon coming to Sardinia, found that Godas was
assuming the name and wearing the dress of a king and that he had
attached a body-guard to his person. And when Godas read the emperor's
letter, he said that it was his wish to have soldiers, indeed, come to
fight along with him, but as for a commander, he had absolutely no
desire for one. And having written to the emperor in this sense, he
dismissed Eulogius.</p>
<p>
XI</p>
<p>
The emperor, meanwhile, not having yet ascertained these things, was
preparing four hundred soldiers with Cyril as commander, who were to
assist Godas in guarding the island. And with them he also had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xi_2" id="PageIII_xi_2">[2-7]</a></span>
in readiness the expedition against Carthage, ten thousand
foot-soldiers, and five thousand horsemen, gathered from the regular
troops and from the "foederati." Now at an earlier time only
barbarians were enlisted among the foederati, those, namely, who had
come into the Roman political system, not in the condition of slaves,
since they had not been conquered by the Romans, but on the basis of
complete equality.<a name="FNanchor_37_III" id="FNanchor_37_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_III" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
 For the Romans call treaties with their enemies
"foedera." But at the present time there is nothing to prevent anyone
from assuming this name, since time will by no means consent to keep
names attached to the things to which they were formerly applied, but
conditions are ever changing about according to the desire of men who
control them, and men pay little heed to the meaning which they
originally attached to a name. And the commanders of the foederati
were Dorotheus, the general of the troops in Armenia, and Solomon, who
was acting as manager for the general Belisarius; (such a person the
Romans call "domesticus." Now this Solomon was a eunuch, but it was
not by the devising of man that he had suffered mutilation, but some
accident which befell him while in swaddling clothes had imposed this
lot upon him); and there were also Cyprian, Valerian, Martinus,
Althias, John, Marcellus, and the Cyril whom I have mentioned above;
and the commanders of the regular cavalry were Rufinus and Agan, who
were of the house of Belisarius, and Barbatus and Pappus, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xi_7" id="PageIII_xi_7">[7-16]</a></span>
regular infantry was commanded by Theodorus, who was surnamed
Cteanus, and Terentius, Zadus, Marcian, and Sarapis. And a certain
John, a native of Epidamnus, which is now called Dyrrachium, held
supreme command over all the leaders of infantry. Among all these
commanders Solomon was from a place in the East, at the very extremity
of the Roman domain, where the city called Daras now stands, and Agan
was by birth of the Massagetae whom they now call Huns; and the rest
were almost all inhabitants of the land of Thrace. And there followed
with them also four hundred Eruli, whom Pharas led, and about six
hundred barbarian allies from the nation of the Massagetae, all
mounted bowmen; these were led by Sinnion and Balas, men endowed with
bravery and endurance in the highest degree. And for the whole force
five hundred ships were required, no one of which was able to carry
more than fifty thousand medimni,<a name="FNanchor_38_III" id="FNanchor_38_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_III" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
 nor any one less than three
thousand. And in all the vessels together there were thirty thousand
sailors, Egyptians and Ionians for the most part, and Cilicians, and
one commander was appointed over all the ships, Calonymus of
Alexandria. And they had also ships of war prepared as for
sea-fighting, to the number of ninety-two, and they were single-banked
ships covered by decks, in order that the men rowing them might if
possible not be exposed to the bolts of the enemy. Such boats are
called "dromones"<a name="FNanchor_39_III" id="FNanchor_39_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_III" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
 by those of the present time; for they are able
to attain a great speed. In these sailed two thousand men of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xi_16" id="PageIII_xi_16">[16-23]</a></span>
Byzantium, who were all rowers as well as fighting men; for
there was not a single superfluous man among them. And Archelaus was
also sent, a man of patrician standing who had already been pretorian
prefect both in Byzantium and in Illyricum, but he then held the
position of prefect of the army; for thus the officer charged with the
maintenance of the army is designated. But as general with supreme
authority over all the emperor sent Belisarius, who was in command of
the troops of the East for the second time. And he was followed by
many spearmen and many guards as well, men who were capable warriors
and thoroughly experienced in the dangers of fighting. And the emperor
gave him written instructions, bidding him do everything as seemed
best to him, and stating that his acts would be final, as if the
emperor himself had done them. The writing, in fact, gave him the
power of a king. Now Belisarius was a native of Germania, which lies
between Thrace and Illyricum. These things, then, took place in this
way.</p>
<p>
Gelimer, however, being deprived of Tripolis by Pudentius and of
Sardinia by Godas, scarcely hoped to regain Tripolis, since it was
situated at a great distance and the rebels were already being
assisted by the Romans, against whom just at that moment it seemed to
him best not to take the field; but he was eager to get to the island
before any army sent by the emperor to fight for his enemies should
arrive there. He accordingly selected five thousand of the Vandals and
one hundred and twenty ships of the fastest kind, and appointing as
general his brother Tzazon, he sent them off. And so they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xi_23" id="PageIII_xi_23">[23-30]</a></span>
sailing with great enthusiasm and eagerness against Godas and
Sardinia. In the meantime the Emperor Justinian was sending off
Valerian and Martinus in advance of the others in order to await the
rest of the army in the Peloponnesus. And when these two had embarked
upon their ships, it came to the emperor's mind that there was
something which he wished to enjoin upon them,&mdash;a thing which he had
wished to say previously, but he had been so busied with the other
matters of which he had to speak that his mind had been occupied with
them and this subject had been driven out. He summoned them,
accordingly, intending to say what he wished, but upon considering the
matter, he saw that it would not be propitious for them to interrupt
their journey. He therefore sent men to forbid them either to return
to him or to disembark from their ships. And these men, upon coming
near the ships, commanded them with much shouting and loud cries by no
means to turn back, and it seemed to those present that the thing
which had happened was no good omen and that never would one of the
men in those ships return from Libya to Byzantium. For besides the
omen they suspected that a curse also had come to the men from the
emperor, not at all by his own will, so that they would not return.
Now if anyone should so interpret the incident with regard to these
two commanders, Valerian and Martinus, he will find the original
opinion untrue. But there was a certain man among the body-guards of
Martinus, Stotzas by name, who was destined to be an enemy of the
emperor, to make an attempt to set up a tyranny, and by no means to
return to Byzantium, and one might suppose that curse to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xi_30" id="PageIII_xi_30">[30-5]</a></span>
been turned upon him by Heaven. But whether this matter stands
thus or otherwise, I leave to each one to reason out as he wishes. But
I shall proceed to tell how the general Belisarius and the army
departed.</p>
<p>
XII</p>
<p>
<span class="sidenote"> 533 A.D.</span>
In the seventh year of Justinian's reign, at about the spring equinox,
the emperor commanded the general's ship to anchor off the point
which is before the royal palace. Thither came also Epiphanius, the
chief priest of the city, and after uttering an appropriate prayer, he
put on the ships one of the soldiers who had lately been baptized and
had taken the Christian name. And after this the general Belisarius
and Antonina, his wife, set sail. And there was with them also
Procopius, who wrote this history; now previously he had been
exceedingly terrified at the danger, but later he had seen a vision in
his sleep which caused him to take courage and made him eager to go on
the expedition. For it seemed in the dream that he was in the house of
Belisarius, and one of the servants entering announced that some men
had come bearing gifts; and Belisarius bade him investigate what sort
of gifts they were, and he went out into the court and saw men who
carried on their shoulders earth with the flowers and all. And he bade
him bring these men into the house and deposit the earth they were
carrying in the portico; and Belisarius together with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xii_5" id="PageIII_xii_5">[5-10]</a></span>
guardsmen came there, and he himself reclined on that earth and
ate of the flowers, and urged the others to do likewise; and as they
reclined and ate, as if upon a couch, the food seemed to them
exceedingly sweet. Such, then, was the vision of the dream.</p>
<p>
And the whole fleet followed the general's ship, and they put in at
Perinthus, which is now called Heracleia,<a name="FNanchor_40_III" id="FNanchor_40_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_III" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
 where five days' time
was spent by the army, since at that place the general received as a
present from the emperor an exceedingly great number of horses from
the royal pastures, which are kept for him in the territory of Thrace.
And setting sail from there, they anchored off Abydus, and it came
about as they were delaying there four days on account of the lack of
wind that the following event took place. Two Massagetae killed one of
their comrades who was ridiculing them, in the midst of their
intemperate drinking; for they were intoxicated. For of all men the
Massagetae are the most intemperate drinkers. Belisarius, accordingly,
straightway impaled these two men on the hill which is near Abydus.
And since all, and especially the relatives of these two men, were
angry and declared that it was not in order to be punished nor to be
subject to the laws of the Romans that they had entered into an
alliance (for their own laws did not make the punishment for murder
such <i>as</i> this, they said); and since they were joined in voicing the
accusation against the general even by Roman soldiers, who were
anxious that there should be no punishment for their offences,
Belisarius called together both the Massagetae and the rest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xii_10" id="PageIII_xii_10">[10-18]</a></span>
army and spoke as follows: "If my words were addressed to men
now for the first time entering into war, it would require a long time
for me to convince you by speech how great a help justice is for
gaining the victory. For those who do not understand the fortunes of
such struggles think that the outcome of war lies in strength of arm
alone. But you, who have often conquered an enemy not inferior to you
in strength of body and well endowed with valour, you who have often
tried your strength against your opponents, you, I think, are not
ignorant that, while it is men who always do the fighting in either
army, it is God who judges the contest as seems best to Him and
bestows the victory in battle. Now since this is so, it is fitting to
consider good bodily condition and practice in arms and all the other
provision for war of less account than justice and those things which
pertain to God. For that which may possibly be of greatest advantage
to men in need would naturally be honoured by them above all other
things. Now the first proof of justice would be the punishment of
those who have committed unjust murder. For if it is incumbent upon us
to sit in judgment upon the actions which from time to time are
committed by men toward their neighbours, and to adjudge and to name
the just and the unjust action, we should find that nothing is more
precious to a man than his life. And if any barbarian who has slain
his kinsman expects to find indulgence in his trial on the ground that
he was drunk, in all fairness he makes the charge so much the worse by
reason of the very circumstance by which, as he alleges, his guilt is
removed. For it is not right for a man under any circumstances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xii_18" id="PageIII_xii_18">[18-2]</a></span>
and especially when serving in an army, to be so drunk as readily to
kill his dearest friends; nay, the drunkenness itself, even if the
murder is not added at all, is worthy of punishment; and when a
kinsman is wronged, the crime would clearly be of greater moment as
regards punishment than when committed against those who are not
kinsmen, at least in the eyes of men of sense. Now the example is
before you and you may see what sort of an outcome such actions have.
But as for you, it is your duty to avoid laying violent hands upon
anyone without provocation, or carrying off the possessions of others;
for I shall not overlook it, be assured, and I shall not consider
anyone of you a fellow-soldier of mine, no matter how terrible he is
reputed to be to the foe, who is not able to use clean hands against
the enemy. For bravery cannot be victorious unless it be arrayed along
with justice." So spoke Belisarius. And the whole army, hearing what
was said and looking up at the two men impaled, felt an overwhelming
fear come over them and took thought to conduct their lives with
moderation, for they saw that they would not be free from great danger
if they should be caught doing anything unlawful.</p>
<p>
XIII</p>
<p>
After this Belisarius bethought him how his whole fleet should always
keep together as it sailed and should anchor in the same place. For he
knew that in a large fleet, and especially if rough winds should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xiii_2" id="PageIII_xiii_2">[2-8]</a></span>
assail them, it was inevitable that many of the ships should be left
behind and scattered on the open sea, and that their pilots should not
know which of the ships that put to sea ahead of them it was better to
follow. So after considering the matter, he did as follows. The sails
of the three ships in which he and his following were carried he
painted red from the upper corner for about one third of their length,
and he erected upright poles on the prow of each, and hung lights from
them, so that both by day and by night the general's ships might be
distinguishable; then he commanded all the pilots to follow these
ships. Thus with the three ships leading the whole fleet not a single
ship was left behind. And whenever they were about to put out from a
harbour, the trumpets announced this to them.</p>
<p>
And upon setting out from Abydus they met with strong winds which
carried them to Sigeum. And again in calm weather they proceeded more
leisurely to Malea, where the calm proved of the greatest advantage to
them. For since they had a great fleet and exceedingly large ships, as
night came on everything was thrown into confusion by reason of their
being crowded into small space, and they were brought into extreme
peril. At that time both the pilots and the rest of the sailors shewed
themselves skilful and efficient, for while shouting at the top of
their voices and making a great noise they kept pushing the ships
apart with their poles, and cleverly kept the distances between their
different vessels; but if a wind had arisen, whether a following or a
head wind, it seems to me that the sailors would hardly have preserved
themselves and their ships. But as it was, they escaped, as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xiii_8" id="PageIII_xiii_8">[8-15]</a></span>
have said, and put in at Taenarum, which is now called Caenopolis.<a name="FNanchor_41_III" id="FNanchor_41_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_III" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Then, pressing on from there, they touched at Methone, and found
Valerian and Martinus with their men, who had reached the same place a
short time before. And since there were no winds blowing, Belisarius
anchored the ships there, and disembarked the whole army; and after
they were on shore he assigned the commanders their positions and drew
up the soldiers. And while he was thus engaged and no wind at all
arose, it came about that many of the soldiers were destroyed by
disease caused in the following manner.</p>
<p>
The pretorian prefect, John, was a man of worthless character, and so
skilful at devising ways of bringing money into the public treasury to
the detriment of men that I, for my part, should never be competent to
describe this trait of his. But this has been said in the preceding
pages, when I was brought to this point by my narrative.<a name="FNanchor_42_III" id="FNanchor_42_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_III" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
 But I
shall tell in the present case in what manner he destroyed the
soldiers. The bread which soldiers are destined to eat in camp must of
necessity be put twice into the oven, and be cooked so carefully as to
last for a very long period and not spoil in a short time, and loaves
cooked in this way necessarily weigh less; and for this reason, when
such bread is distributed, the soldiers generally received as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xiii_15" id="PageIII_xiii_15">[15-21]</a></span>
their portion one-fourth more than the usual weight.<a name="FNanchor_43_III" id="FNanchor_43_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_III" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
 John,
therefore, calculating how he might reduce the amount of firewood used
and have less to pay to the bakers in wages, and also how he might not
lose in the weight of the bread, brought the still uncooked dough to
the public baths of Achilles, in the basement of which the fire is
kept burning, and bade his men set it down there. And when it seemed
to be cooked in some fashion or other, he threw it into bags, put it
on the ships, and sent it off. And when the fleet arrived at Methone,
the loaves disintegrated and returned again to flour, not wholesome
flour, however, but rotten and becoming mouldy and already giving out
a sort of oppressive odour. And the loaves were dispensed by
measure<a name="FNanchor_44_III" id="FNanchor_44_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_III" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
 to the soldiers by those to whom this office was assigned,
and they were already making the distribution of the bread by quarts
and bushels. And the soldiers, feeding upon this in the summer time in
a place where the climate is very hot, became sick, and not less than
five hundred of them died; and the same thing was about to happen to
more, but Belisarius prevented it by ordering the bread of the country
to be furnished them. And reporting tke matter to the emperor, he
himself gained in favour, but he did not at that time bring any
punishment upon John.</p>
<p>
These events, then, took place in the manner described. And setting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xiii_21" id="PageIII_xiii_21">[21-23]</a></span>
out from Methone they reached the harbour of Zacynthus, where
they took in enough water to last them in crossing the Adriatic Sea,
and after making all their other preparations, sailed on. But since
the wind they had was very gentle and languid, it was only on the
sixteenth day that they came to land at a deserted place in Sicily
near which Mount Aetna rises. And while they were being delayed in
this passage, as has been said, it so happened that the water of the
whole fleet was spoiled, except that which Belisarius himself and his
table-companions were drinking. For this alone was preserved by the
wife of Belisarius in the following manner. She filled with water jars
made of glass and constructed a small room with planks in the hold of
the ship where it was impossible for the sun to penetrate, and there
she sank the jars in sand, and by this means the water remained
unaffected. So much, then, for this.</p>
<p>
XIV</p>
<p>
And as soon as Belisarius had disembarked upon the island, he began to
feel restless, knowing not how to proceed, and his mind was tormented
by the thought that he did not know what sort of men the Vandals were
against whom he was going, and how strong they were in war, or in what
manner the Romans would have to wage the war, or what place would be
their base of operations. But most of all he was disturbed by the
soldiers, who were in mortal dread of sea-fighting and had no shame in
saying beforehand that, if they should be disembarked on the land,
they would try to show themselves brave men in the battle, but if
hostile ships assailed them, they would turn to flight; for,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xiv_2" id="PageIII_xiv_2">[2-7]</a></span>
they said, they were not able to contend against two enemies at once,
both men and water. Being at a loss, therefore, because of all these
things, he sent Procopius, his adviser, to Syracuse, to find out
whether the enemy had any ships in ambush keeping watch over the
passage across the sea, either on the island or on the continent, and
where it would be best for them to anchor in Libya, and from what
point as base it would be advantageous for them to start in carrying
on the war against the Vandals. And he bade him, when he should have
accomplished his commands, return and meet him at the place called
Caucana,<a name="FNanchor_45_III" id="FNanchor_45_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_III" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
 about two hundred stades distant from Syracuse, where
both he and the whole fleet were to anchor. But he let it be
understood that he was sending him to buy provisions, since the Goths
were willing to give them a market, this having been decided upon by
the Emperor Justinian and Amalasountha, the mother of Antalaric,<a name="FNanchor_46_III" id="FNanchor_46_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_III" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
who was at that time a boy being reared under the care of his mother,
Amalasountha, and held sway over both the Goths and the Italians. For
when Theoderic had died and the kingdom came to his nephew, Antalaric,
who had already before this lost his father, Amalasountha was fearful
both for her child and for the kingdom and cultivated the friendship
of Justinian very carefully, and she gave heed to his commands in all
matters and at that time promised to provide a market for his army and
did so.</p>
<p>
Now when Procopius reached Syracuse, he unexpectedly met a man who had
been a fellow-citizen and friend of his from childhood, who had been
living in Syracuse for a long time engaged in the shipping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xiv_7" id="PageIII_xiv_7">[7-13]</a></span>
business, and he learned from him what he wanted; for this man showed
him a domestic who had three days before that very day come from
Carthage, and he said that they need not suspect that there would be
any ambush set for the fleet by the Vandals. For from no one in the
world had they learned that an army was coming against them at that
time, but all the active men among the Vandals had actually a little
before gone on an expedition against Godas. And for this reason
Gelimer, with no thought of an enemy in his mind and regardless of
Carthage and all the other places on the sea, was staying in Hermione,
which is in Byzacium, four days' journey distant from the coast; so
that it was possible for them to sail without fearing any difficulty
and to anchor wherever the wind should call them. When Procopius heard
this, he took the hand of the domestic and walked to the harbour of
Arethousa where his boat lay at anchor, making many enquiries of the
man and searching out every detail. And going on board the ship with
him, he gave orders to raise the sails and to make all speed for
Caucana. And since the master of the domestic stood on the shore
wondering that he did not give him back the man, Procopius shouted
out, when the ship was already under way, begging him not to be angry
with him; for it was necessary that the domestic should meet the
general, and, after leading the army to Libya, would return after no
long time to Syracuse with much money in his pocket.</p> <p>But upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xiv_14" id="PageIII_xiv_14">[14-2]</a></span>
coming to Caucana they found all in deep grief. For Dorotheus, the
general of the troops of Armenia, had died there, leaving to the whole
army a great sense of loss. But Belisarius, when the domestic had come
before him and related his whole story, became exceedingly glad, and
after bestowing many praises upon Procopius, he issued orders to give
the signal for departure with the trumpets. And setting sail quickly
they touched at the islands of Gaulus and Melita,<a name="FNanchor_47_III" id="FNanchor_47_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_III" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
 which mark the
boundary between the Adriatic and Tuscan Seas. There a strong east
wind arose for them, and on the following day it carried the ships to
the point of Libya, at the place which the Romans call in their own
tongue "Shoal's Head." For its name is "Caputvada," and it is five
days' journey from Carthage for an unencumbered traveller.</p>
<p>
XV</p>
<p>
And when they came near the shore, the general bade them furl the
sails, throw out anchors from the ships, and make a halt; and calling
together all the commanders to his own ship, he opened a discussion
with regard to the disembarkation. Thereupon many speeches were made
inclining to either side, and Archelaus came forward and spoke as
follows:</p>
<p>
"I admire, indeed, the virtue of our general, who, while surpassing
all by far in judgment and possessing the greatest wealth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xv_2" id="PageIII_xv_2">[2-10]</a></span>
experience, and at the same time holding the power alone, has
proposed an open discussion and bids each one of us speak, so that we
shall be able to choose whichever course seems best, though it is
possible for him to decide alone on what is needful and at his leisure
to put it into execution as he wishes. But as for you, my fellow
officers&mdash;I do not know how I am to say it easily&mdash;one might wonder
that each one did not hasten to be the first to oppose the
disembarkation. And yet I understand that the making of suggestions to
those who are entering upon a perilous course brings no personal
advantage to him who offers the advice, but as a general thing results
in bringing blame upon him. For when things go well for men, they
attribute their success to their own judgment or to fortune, but when
they fail, they blame only the one who has advised them. Nevertheless
I shall speak out. For it is not right for those who deliberate about
safety to shrink from blame. You are purposing to disembark on the
enemy's land, fellow-officers; but in what harbour are you planning to
place the ships in safety? Or in what city's wall will you find
security for yourselves? Have you not then heard that this
promontory&mdash;I mean from Carthage to Iouce&mdash;extends, they say, for a
journey of nine days, altogether without harbours and lying open to
the wind from whatever quarter it may blow? And not a single walled
town is left in all Libya except Carthage, thanks to the decision of
Gizeric.<a name="FNanchor_48_III" id="FNanchor_48_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_III" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
 And one might add that in this place, they say, water is
entirely lacking. Come now, if you wish, let us suppose that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xv_10" id="PageIII_xv_10">[10-17]</a></span>
some adversity befall us, and with this in view make the decision. For
that those who enter into contests of arms should expect no difficulty
is not in keeping with human experience nor with the nature of things.
If, then, after we have disembarked upon the mainland, a storm should
fall upon us, will it not be necessary that one of two things befall
the ships, either that they flee away as far as possible, or perish
upon this promontory? Secondly, what means will there be of supplying
us with necessities? Let no one look to me as the officer charged with
the maintenance of the army. For every official, when deprived of the
means of administering his office, is of necessity reduced to the name
and character of a private person. And where shall we deposit our
superfluous arms or any other part of our necessaries when we are
compelled to receive the attack of the barbarians? Nay, as for this,
it is not well even to say how it will turn out. But I think that we
ought to make straight for Carthage. For they say that there is a
harbour called Stagnum not more than forty stades distant from that
city, which is entirely unguarded and large enough for the whole
fleet. And if we make this the base of our operations, we shall carry
on the war without difficulty. And I, for my part, think it likely
that we shall win Carthage by a sudden attack, especially since the
enemy are far away from it, and that after we have won it we shall
have no further trouble. For it is a way with all men's undertakings
that when the chief point has been captured, they collapse after no
long time. It behoves us, therefore, to bear in mind all these things
and to choose the best course." So spoke Archelaus.</p> <p>And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xv_18" id="PageIII_xv_18">[18-25]</a></span>
Belisarius spoke as follows: "Let no one of you, fellow-officers,
think that my words are those of censure, nor that they are spoken in
the last place to the end that it may become necessary for all to
follow them, of whatever sort they may be. For I have heard what seems
best to each one of you, and it is becoming that I too should lay
before you what I think, and then with you should choose the better
course. But it is right to remind you of this fact, that the soldiers
said openly a little earlier that they feared the dangers by sea and
would turn to flight if a hostile ship should attack them, and we
prayed God to shew us the land of Libya and allow us a peaceful
disembarkation upon it. And since this is so, I think it the part of
foolish men first to pray to receive from God the more favourable
fortune, then when this is given them, to reject it and go in the
contrary direction. And if we do sail straight for Carthage and a
hostile fleet encounters us, the soldiers will remain without blame,
if they flee with all their might&mdash;for a delinquency announced
beforehand carries with it its own defence&mdash;but for us, even if we
come through safely, there will be no forgiveness. Now while there are
many difficulties if we remain in the ships, it will be sufficient, I
think, to mention only one thing,&mdash;that by which especially they wish
to frighten us when they hold over our heads the danger of a storm.
For if any storm should fall upon us, one of two things, they say,
must necessarily befall the ships, either that they flee far from
Libya or be destroyed upon this headland. What then under the present
circumstances will be more to our advantage to choose? to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xv_25" id="PageIII_xv_25">[25-31]</a></span>
the ships alone destroyed, or to have lost everything, men and all?
But apart from this, at the present time we shall fall upon the enemy
unprepared, and in all probability shall fare as we desire; for in
warfare it is the unexpected which is accustomed to govern the course
of events. But a little later, when the enemy have already made their
preparation, the struggle we shall have will be one of strength evenly
matched. And one might add that it will be necessary perhaps to fight
even for the disembarkation, and to seek for that which now we have
within our grasp but over which we are deliberating as a thing not
necessary. And if at the very time, when we are engaged in conflict, a
storm also comes upon us, as often happens on the sea, then while
struggling both against the waves and against the Vandals, we shall
come to regret our prudence. As for me, then, I say that we must
disembark upon the land with all possible speed, landing horses and
arms and whatever else we consider necessary for our use, and that we
must dig a trench quickly and throw a stockade around us of a kind
which can contribute to our safety no less than any walled town one
might mention, and with that as our base must carry on the war from
there if anyone should attack us. And if we shew ourselves brave men,
we shall lack nothing in the way of provisions. For those who hold the
mastery over their enemy are lords also of the enemy's possessions;
and it is the way of victory, first to invest herself with all the
wealth, and then to set it down again on that side to which she
inclines. Therefore, for you both the chance of safety and of having
an abundance of good things lies in your own hands."
</p> <p>
When Belisarius had said this, the whole assembly agreed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xv_31" id="PageIII_xv_31">[31-36]</a></span>
adopted his proposal, and separating from one another, they made the
disembarkation as quickly as possible, about three months later than
their departure from Byzantium. And indicating a certain spot on the
shore the general bade both soldiers and sailors dig the trench and
place the stockade about it. And they did as directed. And since a
great throng was working and fear was stimulating their enthusiasm and
the general was urging them on, not only was the trench dug on the
same day, but the stockade was also completed and the pointed stakes
were fixed in place all around. Then, indeed, while they were digging
the trench, something happened which was altogether amazing. A great
abundance of water sprang forth from the earth, a thing which had not
happened before in Byzacium, and besides this the place where they
were was altogether waterless. Now this water sufficed for all uses of
both men and animals. And in congratulating the general, Procopius
said that he rejoiced at the abundance of water, not so much because
of its usefulness, as because it seemed to him a symbol of an easy
victory, and that Heaven was foretelling a victory to them. This, at
any rate, actually came to pass. So for that night all the soldiers
bivouacked in the camp, setting guards and doing everything else as
was customary, except, indeed, that Belisarius commanded five bowmen
to remain in each ship for the purpose of a guard, and that the
ships-of-war should anchor in a circle about them, taking care that no
one should come against them to do them harm.</p>
<p>
XVI</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xvi_1" id="PageIII_xvi_1">[1-5]</a></span>
<p>
But on the following day, when some of the soldiers went out into the
fields and laid hands on the fruit, the general inflicted corporal
punishment of no casual sort upon them, and he called all the army
together and spoke as follows: "This using of violence and the eating
of that which belongs to others seems at other times a wicked thing
only on this account, that injustice is in the deed itself, as the
saying is; but in the present instance so great an element of
detriment is added to the wrongdoing that&mdash;if it is not too harsh to
say so&mdash;we must consider the question of justice of less account and
calculate the magnitude of the danger that may arise from your act.
For I have disembarked you upon this land basing my confidence on this
alone, that the Libyans, being Romans from of old, are unfaithful and
hostile to the Vandals, and for this reason I thought that no
necessaries would fail us and, besides, that the enemy would not do us
any injury by a sudden attack. But now this your lack of self-control
has changed it all and made the opposite true. For you have doubtless
reconciled the Libyans to the Vandals, bringing their hostility round
upon your own selves. For by nature those who are wronged feel enmity
toward those who have done them violence, and it has come round to
this that you have exchanged your own safety and a bountiful supply of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xvi_5" id="PageIII_xvi_5">[5-10]</a></span>
good things for some few pieces of silver, when it was possible
for you, by purchasing provisions from willing owners, not to appear
unjust and at the same time to enjoy their friendship to the utmost.
Now, therefore, the war will be between you and both Vandals and
Libyans, and I, at least, say further that it will be against God
himself, whose aid no one who does wrong can invoke. But do you cease
trespassing wantonly upon the possessions of others, and reject a gain
which is full of dangers. For this is that time in which above all
others moderation is able to save, but lawlessness leads to death. For
if you give heed to these things, you will find God propitious, the
Libyan people well-disposed, and the race of the Vandals open to your
attack."</p>
<p>
With these words Belisarius dismissed the assembly. And at that time
he heard that the city of Syllectus was distant one day's journey from
the camp, lying close to the sea on the road leading to Carthage, and
that the wall of this city had been torn down for a long time, but the
inhabitants of the place had made a barrier on all sides by means of
the walls of their houses, on account of the attacks of the Moors, and
guarded a kind of fortified enclosure; he, accordingly, sent one of
his spearmen, Boriades, together with some of the guards, commanding
them to make an attempt oh the city, and, if they captured it, to do
no harm in it, but to promise a thousand good things and to say that
they had come for the sake of the people's freedom, that so the army
might be able to enter into it. And they came near the city about dusk
and passed the night hidden in a ravine. But at early dawn, meeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xvi_10" id="PageIII_xvi_10">[10-14]</a></span>
country folk going into the city with waggons, they entered
quietly with them and with no trouble took possession of the city. And
when day came, no one having begun any disturbance, they called
together the priest and all the other notables and announced the
commands of the general, and receiving the keys of the entrances from
willing hands, they sent them to the general.</p>
<p>
On the same day the overseer of the public post deserted, handing over
all the government horses. And they captured also one of those who are
occasionally sent to bear the royal responses, whom they call
"veredarii"<a name="FNanchor_49_III" id="FNanchor_49_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_III" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
; and the general did him no harm but presented him
with much gold and, receiving pledges from him, put into his hand the
letter which the Emperor Justinian had written to the Vandals, that he
might give it to the magistrates of the Vandals. And the writing was
as follows: "Neither have we decided to make war upon the Vandals, nor
are we breaking the treaty of Gizeric, but we are attempting to
dethrone your tyrant, who, making light of the testament of Gizeric,
has imprisoned your king and is keeping him in custody, and those of
his relatives whom he hated exceedingly he put to death at the first,
and the rest, after robbing them of their sight, he keeps under guard,
not allowing them to terminate their misfortunes by death. Do you,
therefore, join forces with us and help us in freeing yourselves from
so wicked a tyranny, in order that you may be able to enjoy both peace
and freedom. For we give you pledges in the name of God that these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xvi_14" id="PageIII_xvi_14">[14-5]</a></span>
things will come to you by our hand." Such was the message of
the emperor's letter. But the man who received this from Belisarius
did not dare to publish it openly, and though he shewed it secretly to
his friends, he accomplished nothing whatever of consequence.</p>
<p>
XVII</p>
<p>
And Belisarius, having arrayed his army as for battle in the following
manner, began the march to Carthage. He chose out three hundred of his
guards, men who were able warriors, and handed them over to John, who
was in charge of the expenditures of the general's household; such a
person the Romans call "optio."<a name="FNanchor_50_III" id="FNanchor_50_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_III" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
 And he was an Armenian by birth, a
man gifted with discretion and courage in the highest degree. This
John, then, he commanded to go ahead of the army, at a distance of not
less than twenty stades, and if he should see anything of the enemy,
to report it with all speed, so that they might not be compelled to
enter into battle unprepared. And the allied Massagetae he commanded
to travel constantly on the left of the army, keeping as many stades
away or more; and he himself marched in the rear with the best troops.
For he suspected that it would not be long before Gelimer, following
them from Hermione, would make an attack upon them. And these
precautions were sufficient, for on the right side there was no fear,
since they were travelling not far from the coast. And he commanded
the sailors to follow along with them always and not to separate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xvii_5" id="PageIII_xvii_5">[5-10]</a></span>
themselves far from the army, but when the wind was favouring to
lower the great sails, and follow with the small sails, which they
call "dolones,"<a name="FNanchor_51_III" id="FNanchor_51_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_III" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
 and when the wind dropped altogether to keep the
ships under way as well as they could by rowing.</p>
<p>
And when Belisarius reached Syllectus, the soldiers behaved with
moderation, and they neither began any unjust brawls nor did anything
out of the way, and he himself, by displaying great gentleness and
kindness, won the Libyans to his side so completely that thereafter he
made the journey as if in his own land; for neither did the
inhabitants of the land withdraw nor did they wish to conceal
anything, but they both furnished a market and served the soldiers in
whatever else they wished. And accomplishing eighty stades each day,
we completed the whole journey to Carthage, passing the night either
in a city, should it so happen, or in a camp made as thoroughly secure
as the circumstances permitted. Thus we passed through the city of
Leptis and Hadrumetum and reached the place called Grasse, three
hundred and fifty stades distant from Carthage. In that place was a
palace of the ruler of the Vandals and a park the most beautiful of
all we know. For it is excellently watered by springs and has a great
wealth of woods. And all the trees are full of fruit; so that each one
of the soldiers pitched his tent among fruit-trees, and though all of
them ate their fill of the fruit, which was then ripe, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xvii_10" id="PageIII_xvii_10">[10-16]</a></span>
was practically no diminution to be seen in the fruit.</p>
<p>
But Gelimer, as soon as he heard in Hermione that the enemy were at
hand, wrote to his brother Ammatas in Carthage to kill Ilderic and all
the others, connected with him either by birth or otherwise, whom he
was keeping under guard, and commanded him to make ready the Vandals
and all others in the city serviceable for war, in order that, when
the enemy got inside the narrow passage at the suburb of the city
which they call Decimum,<a name="FNanchor_52_III" id="FNanchor_52_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_III" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
 they might come together from both sides
and surround them and, catching them as in a net, destroy them. And
Ammatas carried this out, and killed Ilderic, who was a relative of
his, and Euagees, and all the Libyans who were intimate with them. For
Hoamer had already departed from the world.<a name="FNanchor_53_III" id="FNanchor_53_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_III" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
 And arming the
Vandals, he made them ready, intending to make his attack at the
opportune moment. But Gelimer was following behind, without letting it
be known to us, except, indeed, that, on that night when we bivouacked
in Grasse, scouts coming from both armies met each other, and after an
exchange of blows they each retired to their own camp, and in this way
it became evident to us that the enemy were not far away. As we
proceeded from there it was impossible to discern the ships. For high
rocks extending well into the sea cause mariners to make a great
circuit, and there is a projecting headland,<a name="FNanchor_54_III" id="FNanchor_54_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_III" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
 inside of which lies
the town of Hermes. Belisarius therefore commanded Archelaus, the
prefect, and Calonymus, the admiral, not to put in at Carthage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xvii_16" id="PageIII_xvii_16">[16-4]</a></span>
but to remain about two hundred stades away until he himself should
summon them. And departing from Grasse we came on the fourth day to
Decimum, seventy stades distant from Carthage.</p>
<p>
XVIII</p>
<p>
And on that day Gelimer commanded his nephew Gibamundus with two
thousand of the Vandals to go ahead of the rest of the army on the
left side, in order that Ammatas coming from Carthage, Gelimer himself
from the rear, and Gibamundus from the country to the left, might
unite and accomplish the task of encircling the enemy with less
difficulty and exertion. But as for me, during this struggle I was
moved to wonder at the ways of Heaven and of men, noting how God, who
sees from afar what will come to pass, traces out the manner in which
it seems best to him that things should come to pass, while men,
whether they are deceived or counsel aright, know not that they have
failed, should that be the issue, or that they have succeeded, God's
purpose being that a path shall be made for Fortune, who presses on
inevitably toward that which has been foreordained. For if Belisarius
had not thus arranged his forces, commanding the men under John to
take the lead, and the Massagetae to march on the left of the army, we
should never have been able to escape the Vandals. And even with this
planned so by Belisarius, if Ammatas had observed the opportune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xviii_4" id="PageIII_xviii_4">[4-11]</a></span>
time, and had not anticipated this by about the fourth part of a day,
never would the cause of the Vandals have fallen as it did; but as it
was, Ammatas came to Decimum about midday, in advance of the time,
while both we and the Vandal army were far away, erring not only in
that he did not arrive at the fitting time, but also in leaving at
Carthage the host of the Vandals, commanding them to come to Decimum
as quickly as possible, while he with a few men and not even the pick
of the army came into conflict with John's men. And he killed twelve
of the best men who were fighting in the front rank, and he himself
fell, having shewn himself a brave man in this engagement. And the
rout, after Ammatas fell, became complete, and the Vandals, fleeing at
top speed, swept back all those who were coming from Carthage to
Decimum. For they were advancing in no order and not drawn up as for
battle, but in companies, and small ones at that; for they were coming
in bands of twenty or thirty. And seeing the Vandals under Ammatas
fleeing, and thinking their pursuers were a great multitude, they
turned and joined in the flight. And John and his men, killing all
whom they came upon, advanced as far as the gates of Carthage. And
there was so great a slaughter of Vandals in the course of the seventy
stades that those who beheld it would have supposed that it was the
work of an enemy twenty thousand strong.</p>
<p> At the same time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xviii_12" id="PageIII_xviii_12">[12-19]</a></span>
Gibamundus and his two thousand came to Pedion Halon, which is forty
stades distant from Decimum on the left as one goes to Carthage, and
is destitute of human habitation or trees or anything else, since the
salt in the water permits nothing except salt to be produced there; in
that place they encountered the Huns and were all destroyed. Now there
was a certain man among the Massagetae, well gifted with courage and
strength of body, the leader of a few men; this man had the privilege
handed down from his fathers and ancestors to be the first in all the
Hunnic armies to attack the enemy. For it was not lawful for a man of
the Massagetae to strike first in battle and capture one of the enemy
until, indeed, someone from this house began the struggle with the
enemy. So when the two armies had come not far from each other, this
man rode out and stopped alone close to the army of the Vandals. And
the Vandals, either because they were dumbfounded at the courageous
spirit of the man or perhaps because they suspected that the enemy
were contriving something against them, decided neither to move nor to
shoot at the man. And I think that, since they had never had
experience of battle with the Massagetae, but heard that the nation
was very warlike, they were for this reason terrified at the danger.
And the man, returning to his compatriots, said that God had sent them
these strangers as a ready feast. Then at length they made their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xviii_19" id="PageIII_xviii_19">[19-6]</a></span>
onset and the Vandals did not withstand them, but breaking their ranks
and never thinking of resistance, they were all disgracefully
destroyed.</p>
<p>
XIX</p>
<p>
But we, having learned nothing at all of what had happened, were going
on to Decimum. And Belisarius, seeing a place well adapted for a camp,
thirty-five stades distant from Decimum, surrounded it with a stockade
which was very well made, and placing all the infantry there and
calling together the whole army, he spoke as follows: "Fellow-soldiers, the decisive moment of the struggle is already at
hand; for I perceive that the enemy are advancing upon us; and the
ships have been taken far away from us by the nature of the place; and
it has come round to this that our hope of safety lies in the strength
of our hands. For there is not a friendly city, no, nor any other
stronghold, in which we may put our trust and have confidence
concerning ourselves. But if we should show ourselves brave men, it is
probable that we shall still overcome the enemy in the war; but if we
should weaken at all, it will remain for us to fall under the hand of
the Vandals and to be destroyed disgracefully. And yet there are many
advantages on our side to help us on toward victory; for we have with
us both justice, with which we have come against our enemy (for we are
here in order to recover what is our own), and the hatred of the
Vandals toward their own tyrant. For the alliance of God follows
naturally those who put justice forward, and a soldier who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xix_6" id="PageIII_xix_6">[6-14]</a></span>
ill-disposed toward his ruler knows not how to play the part of a
brave man. And apart from this, we have been engaged with Persians and
Scythians all the time, but the Vandals, since the time they conquered
Libya, have seen not a single enemy except naked Moors. And who does
not know that in every work practice leads to skill, while idleness
leads to inefficiency? Now the stockade, from which we shall have to
carry on the war, has been made by us in the best possible manner. And
we are able to deposit here our weapons and everything else which we
are not able to carry when we go forth; and when we return here again,
no kind of provisions can fail us. And I pray that each one of you,
calling to mind his own valour and those whom he has left at home, may
so march with contempt against the enemy."</p>
<p>
After speaking these words and uttering a prayer after them,
Belisarius left his wife and the barricaded camp to the infantry, and
himself set forth with all the horsemen. For it did not seem to him
advantageous for the present to risk an engagement with the whole
army, but it seemed wise to skirmish first with the horsemen and make
trial of the enemy's strength, and finally to fight a decisive battle
with the whole army. Sending forward, therefore, the commanders of the
foederati,<a name="FNanchor_55_III" id="FNanchor_55_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_III" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
 he himself followed with the rest of the force and his
own spearmen and guards. And when the foederati and their leaders
reached Decimum, they saw the corpses of the fallen&mdash;twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xix_14" id="PageIII_xix_14">[14-22]</a></span>
comrades from the forces of John and near them Ammatas and some of the
Vandals. And hearing from the inhabitants of the place the whole story
of the fight, they were vexed, being at a loss as to where they ought
to go. But while they were still at a loss and from the hills were
looking around over the whole country thereabouts, a dust appeared
from the south and a little later a very large force of Vandal
horsemen. And they sent to Belisarius urging him to come as quickly as
possible, since the enemy were bearing down upon them. And the
opinions of the commanders were divided. For some thought that they
ought to close with their assailants, but the others said that their
force was not sufficient for this. And while they were debating thus
among themselves, the barbarians drew near under the leadership of
Gelimer, who was following a road between the one which Belisarius was
travelling and the one by which the Massagetae who had encountered
Gibamundus had come. But since the land was hilly on both sides, it
did not allow him to see either the disaster of Gibamundus or
Belisarius' stockade, nor even the road along which Belisarius' men
were advancing. But when they came near each other, a contest arose
between the two armies as to which should capture the highest of all
the hills there. For it seemed a suitable one to encamp upon, and both
sides preferred to engage with the enemy from there. And the Vandals,
coming first, took possession of the hill by crowding off their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xix_22" id="PageIII_xix_22">[22-28]</a></span>
assailants and routed the enemy, having already become an object of
terror to them. And the Romans in flight came to a place seven stades
distant from Decimum, where, as it happened, Uliaris, the personal
guard of Belisarius, was, with eight hundred guardsmen. And all
supposed that Uliaris would receive them and hold his position, and
together with them would go against the Vandals; but when they came
together, these troops all unexpectedly fled at top speed and went on
the run to Belisarius.</p>
<p>
From then on I am unable to say what happened to Gelimer that, having
the victory in his hands, he willingly gave it up to the enemy, unless
one ought to refer foolish actions also to God, who, whenever He
purposes that some adversity shall befall a man, touches first his
reason and does not permit that which will be to his advantage to come
to his consideration. For if, on the one hand, he had made the pursuit
immediately, I do not think that even Belisarius would have withstood
him, but our cause would have been utterly and completely lost, so
numerous appeared the force of the Vandals and so great the fear they
inspired in the Romans; or if, on the other hand, he had even ridden
straight for Carthage, he would easily have killed all John's men,
who, heedless of everything else, were wandering about the plain one
by one or by twos and stripping the dead. And he would have preserved
the city with its treasures, and captured our ships, which had come
rather near, and he would have withdrawn from us all hope both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xix_28" id="PageIII_xix_28">[28-1]</a></span>
of sailing away and of victory. But in fact he did neither of these
things. Instead he descended from the hill at a walk, and when he
reached the level ground and saw the corpse of his brother, he turned
to lamentations, and, in caring for his burial, he blunted the edge of
his opportunity&mdash;an opportunity which he was not able to grasp again.
Meantime Belisarius, meeting the fugitives, bade them stop, and
arrayed them all in order and rebuked them at length; then, after
hearing of the death of Ammatas and the pursuit of John, and learning
what he wished concerning the place and the enemy, he proceeded at
full speed against Gelimer and the Vandals. But the barbarians, having
already fallen into disorder and being now unprepared, did not
withstand the onset of the Romans, but fled with all their might,
losing many there, and the battle ended at night. Now the Vandals were
in flight, not to Carthage nor to Byzacium, whence they had come, but
to the plain of Boulla and the road leading into Numidia. So the men
with John and the Massagetae returned to us about dusk, and after
learning all that had happened and reporting what they had done, they
passed the night with us in Decimum.</p>
<p>
XX</p>
<p>
But on the following day the infantry with the wife of Belisarius came
up and we all proceeded together on the road toward Carthage, which we
reached in the late evening; and we passed the night in the open,
although no one hindered us from marching into the city at once.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xx_1" id="PageIII_xx_1">[1-7]</a></span>
For the Carthaginians opened the gates and burned lights everywhere
and the city was brilliant with the illumination that whole night, and
those of the Vandals who had been left behind were sitting as
suppliants in the sanctuaries. But Belisarius prevented the entrance
in order to guard against any ambuscade being set for his men by the
enemy, and also to prevent the soldiers from having freedom to turn to
plundering, as they might under the concealment of night. On that day,
since an east wind arose for them, the ships reached the headland, and
the Carthaginians, for they already sighted them, removed the iron
chains of the harbour which they call Mandracium, and made it possible
for the fleet to enter. Now there is in the king's palace a room
filled with darkness, which the Carthaginians call Ancon, where all
were cast with whom the tyrant was angry. In that place, as it
happened, many of the eastern merchants had been confined up to that
time. For Gelimer was angry with these men, charging them with having
urged the emperor on to the war, and they were about to be destroyed,
all of them, this having been decided upon by Gelimer on that day on
which Ammatas was killed in Decimum; to such an extremity of danger
did they come. The guard of this prison, upon hearing what had taken
place in Decimum and seeing the fleet inside the point, entered the
room and enquired of the men, who had not yet learned the good news,
but were sitting in the darkness and expecting death, what among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xx_7" id="PageIII_xx_7">[7-15]</a></span>
their possessions they would be willing to give up and be saved.
And when they said they desired to give everything he might wish, he
demanded nothing of all their treasures, but required them all to
swear that, if they escaped, they would assist him also with all their
power when he came into danger. And they did this. Then he told them
them the whole story, and tearing off a plank from the side toward the
sea, he pointed out the fleet approaching, and releasing all from the
prison went out with them.</p>
<p>
But tile men on the ships, having as yet heard nothing of what the
army had done on the land, were completely at a loss, and slackening
their sails they sent to the town of Mercurium; there they learned
what had taken place at Decimum, and becoming exceedingly joyful
sailed on. And when, with a favouring wind blowing, they came to
within one hundred and fifty stades of Carthage, Archelaus and the
soldiers bade them anchor there, fearing the warning of the general,
but the sailors would not obey. For they said that the promontory at
that point was without a harbour and also that the indications were
that a well-known storm, which the natives call Cypriana, would arise
immediately. And they predicted that, if it came upon them in that
place, they would not be able to save even one of the ships. And it
was as they said. So they slackened their sails for a short time and
deliberated; and they did not think they ought to try for Mandracium
(for they shrank from violating the commands of Belisarius, and at the
same time they suspected that the entrance to Mandracium was closed by
the chains, and besides they feared that this harbour was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xx_15" id="PageIII_xx_15">[15-21]</a></span>
sufficient for the whole fleet) but Stagnum seemed to them well
situated (for it is forty stades distant from Carthage), and there was
nothing in it to hinder them, and also it was large enough for the
whole fleet. There they arrived about dusk and all anchored, except,
indeed, that Calonymus with some of the sailors, disregarding the
general and all the others, went off secretly to Mandracium, no one
daring to hinder him, and plundered the property of the merchants
dwelling on the sea, both foreigners and Carthaginians.</p>
<p>
On the following day Belisarius commanded those on the ships to
disembark, and after marshalling the whole army and drawing it up in
battle formation, he marched into Carthage; for he feared lest he
should encounter some snare set by the enemy. There he reminded the
soldiers at length of how much good fortune had come to them because
they had displayed moderation toward the Libyans, and he exhorted them
earnestly to preserve good order with the greatest care in Carthage.
For all the Libyans had been Romans in earlier times and had come
under the Vandals by no will of their own and had suffered many
outrages at the hands of these barbarians. For this very reason the
emperor had entered into war with the Vandals, and it was not holy
that any harm should come from them to the people whose freedom they
had made the ground for taking the field against the Vandals.

<span class="sidenote"> Sept. 15 533 A.D.</span>

After such words of exhortation he entered Carthage, and, since
no enemy was seen by them, he went up to the palace and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xx_21" id="PageIII_xx_21">[21-3]</a></span>
seated himself on Gelimer's throne. There a crowd of merchants and
other Carthaginians came before Belisarius with much shouting, persons
whose homes were on the sea, and they made the charge that there had
been a robbery of their property on the preceding night by the
sailors. And Belisarius bound Calonymus by oaths to bring without fail
all his thefts to the light. And Calonymus, taking the oath and
disregarding what he had sworn, for the moment made the money his
plunder, but not long afterwards he paid his just penalty in
Byzantium. For being taken with the disease called apoplexy, he became
insane and bit off his own tongue and then died. But this happened at
a later time.</p>
<p>
XXI</p>
<p>
But then, since the hour was appropriate, Belisarius commanded that
lunch be prepared for them, in the very place where Gelimer was
accustomed to entertain the leaders of the Vandals. This place the
Romans call "Delphix," not in their own tongue, but using the Greek
word according to the ancient custom. For in the palace at Rome, where
the dining couches of the emperor were placed, a tripod had stood from
olden times, on which the emperor's cupbearers used to place the cups.
Now the Romans call a tripod "Delphix," since they were first made at
Delphi, and from this both in Byzantium and wherever there is a king's
dining couch they call the room "Delphix"; for the Romans follow the
Greek also in calling the emperor's residence "Palatium." For a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxi_3" id="PageIII_xxi_3">[3-10]</a></span>
Greek named Pallas lived in this place before the capture of Troy and
built a noteworthy house there, and they called this dwelling
"Palatium"; and when Augustus received the imperial power, he decided
to take up his first residence in that house, and from this they call
the place wherever the emperor resides "Palatium." So Belisarius dined
in the Delphix and with him all the notables of the army. And it
happened that the lunch made for Gelimer on the preceding day was in
readiness. And we feasted on that very food and the domestics of
Gelimer served it and poured the wine and waited upon us in every way.
And it was possible to see Fortune in her glory and making a display
of the fact that all things are hers and that nothing is the private
possession of any man. And it fell to the lot of Belisarius on that
day to win such fame as no one of the men of his time ever won nor
indeed any of the men of olden times. For though the Roman soldiers
were not accustomed to enter a subject city without confusion, even if
they numbered only five hundred, and especially if they made the entry
unexpectedly, all the soldiers under the command of this general
showed themselves so orderly that there was not a single act of
insolence nor a threat, and indeed nothing happened to hinder the
business of the city; but in a captured city, one which had changed
its government and shifted its allegiance, it came about that no man's
household was excluded from the privileges of the market-place;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxi_10" id="PageIII_xxi_10">[10-17]</a></span>
on the contrary, the clerks drew up their lists of the men and
conducted the soldiers to their lodgings, just as usual,<a name="FNanchor_56_III" id="FNanchor_56_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_III" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
 and the
soldiers themselves, getting their lunch by purchase from the market,
rested as each one wished.</p>
<p>
Afterwards Belisarius gave pledges to those Vandals who had fled into
the sanctuaries, and began to take thought for the fortifications. For
the circuit-wall of Carthage had been so neglected that in many places
it had become accessible to anyone who wished and easy to attack. For
no small part of it had fallen down, and it was for this reason, the
Carthaginians said, that Gelimer had not made his stand in the city.
For he thought that it would be impossible in a short time to restore
such a circuit-wall to a safe condition. And they said that an old
oracle had been uttered by the children in earlier times in Carthage,
to the effect that "gamma shall pursue beta, and again beta itself
shall pursue gamma." And at that time it had been spoken by the
children in play and had been left as an unexplained riddle, but now
it was perfectly clear to all. For formerly Gizeric had driven out
Boniface and now Belisarius was doing the same to Gelimer. This, then,
whether it was a rumour or an oracle, came out as I have stated.</p>
<p>
At that time a dream also came to light, which had been seen often
before this by many persons, but without being clear as to how it
would turn out. And the dream was as follows. Cyprian,<a name="FNanchor_57_III" id="FNanchor_57_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_III" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
 a holy man,
is reverenced above all others by the Carthaginians. And they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxi_17" id="PageIII_xxi_17">[17-23]</a></span>
have founded a very noteworthy temple in his honour before the city on
the sea-shore, in which they conduct all other customary services, and
also celebrate there a festival which they call the "Cypriana"; and
the sailors are accustomed to name after Cyprian the storm, which I
mentioned lately,<a name="FNanchor_58_III" id="FNanchor_58_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_III" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
 giving it the same name as the festival, since
it is wont to come on at the time at which the Libyans have always
been accustomed to celebrate the festival. This temple the Vandals
took from the Christians by violence in the reign of Honoric. And they
straightway drove out their priests from the temple in great
dishonour, and themselves thereafter attended to the sacred festival
which, they said, now belonged to the Arians. And the Libyans, indeed,
were angry on this account and altogether at a loss, but Cyprian, they
say, often sent them a dream saying that there was not the least need
for the Christians to be concerned about him; for he himself as time
went on would be his own avenger. And when the report of this was
passed around and came to all the Libyans, they were expecting that
some vengeance would come upon the Vandals at some time because of
this sacred festival, but were unable to conjecture how in the world
the vision would be realized for them. Now, therefore, when the
emperor's expedition had come to Libya, since the time had already
come round and would bring the celebration of the festival on the
succeeding day, the priests of the Arians, in spite of the fact that
Ammatas had led the Vandals to Decimum, cleansed the whole sanctuary
and were engaged in hanging up the most beautiful of the votive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxi_23" id="PageIII_xxi_23">[23-5]</a></span>
offerings there, and making ready the lamps and bringing out the
treasures from the store-houses and preparing all things with
exactness, arranging everything according to its appropriate use. But
the events in Decimum turned out in the manner already described. And
the priests of the Arians were off in flight, while the Christians who
conform to the orthodox faith came to the temple of Cyprian, and they
burned all the lamps and attended to the sacred festival just as is
customary for them to perform this service, and thus it was known to
all what the vision of the dream was foretelling. This, then, came
about in this way.</p>
<p>
XXII</p>
<p>
And the Vandals, recalling an ancient saying, marvelled, understanding
clearly thereafter that for a man, at least, no hope could be
impossible nor any possession secure. And what this saying was and in
what manner it was spoken I shall explain. When the Vandals
originally, pressed by hunger, were about to remove from their
ancestral abodes, a certain part of them was left behind who were
reluctant to go and not desirous of following Godigisclus. And as time
went on it seemed to those who had remained that they were well off as
regards abundance of provisions, and Gizeric with his followers gained
possession of Libya. And when this was heard by those who had not
followed Godigisclus, they rejoiced, since thenceforth the country was
altogether sufficient for them to live upon. But fearing lest at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxii_5" id="PageIII_xxii_5">[5-12]</a></span>
some time much later either the very ones who had conquered Libya, or
their descendants, should in some way or other be driven out of Libya
and return to their ancestral homes (for they never supposed that the
Romans would let Libya be held for ever), they sent ambassadors to
them. And these men, upon coming before Gizeric, said that they
rejoiced with their compatriots who had met with such success, but
that they were no longer able to guard the land of which he and his
men had thought so little that they had settled in Libya. They prayed
therefore that, if they laid no claim to their fatherland, they would
bestow it as an unprofitable possession upon themselves, so that their
title to the land might be made as secure as possible, and if anyone
should come to do it harm, they might by no means disdain to die in
behalf of it. Gizeric, accordingly, and all the other Vandals thought
that they spoke fairly and justly, and they were in the act of
granting everything which the envoys desired of them. But a certain
old man who was esteemed among them and had a great reputation for
discretion said that he would by no means permit such a thing. "For in
human affairs," he said, "not one thing stands secure; nay, nothing
which now exists is stable for all time for men, while as regards that
which does not yet exist, there is nothing which may not come to
pass." When Gizeric heard this, he expressed approval and decided to
send the envoys away with nothing accomplished. Now at that time both
he himself and the man who had given the advice were judged worthy of
ridicule by all the Vandals, as foreseeing the impossible. But when
these things which have been told took place, the Vandals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxii_12" id="PageIII_xxii_12">[12-18]</a></span>
learned to take a different view of the nature of human affairs and
realized that the saying was that of a wise man.</p>
<p>
Now as for those Vandals who remained in their native land, neither
remembrance nor any name of them has been preserved to my time.<a name="FNanchor_59_III" id="FNanchor_59_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_III" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>

For since, I suppose, they were a small number, they were either
overpowered by the neighbouring barbarians or they were mingled with
them not at all unwillingly and their name gave way to that of their
conquerors. Indeed, when the Vandals were conquered at that time by
Belisarius, no thought occurred to them to go from there to their
ancestral homes. For they were not able to convey themselves suddenly
from Libya to Europe, especially as they had no ships at hand, but
paid the penalty<a name="FNanchor_60_III" id="FNanchor_60_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_III" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
 there for all the wrongs they had done the Romans
and especially the Zacynthians. For at one time Gizeric, falling
suddenly upon the towns in the Peloponnesus, undertook to assault
Taenarum. And being repulsed from there and losing many of his
followers he retired in complete disorder. And while he was still
filled with anger on account of this, he touched at Zacynthus, and
having killed many of those he met and enslaved five hundred of the
notables, he sailed away soon afterwards. And when he reached the
middle of the Adriatic Sea, as it is called, he cut into small pieces
the bodies of the five hundred and threw them all about the sea
without the least concern. But this happened in earlier times.</p>
<p>
XXIII</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxiii_1" id="PageIII_xxiii_1">[1-9]</a></span>
<p>
But at that time Gelimer, by distributing much money to the farmers
among the Libyans and shewing great friendliness toward them,
succeeded in winning many to his side. These he commanded to kill the
Romans who went out into the country, proclaiming a fixed sum of gold
for each man killed, to be paid to him who did the deed. And they
killed many from the Roman army, not soldiers, however, but slaves and
servants, who because of a desire for money went up into the villages
stealthily and were caught. And the farmers brought their heads before
Gelimer and departed receiving their pay, while he supposed that they
had slain soldiers of the enemy.</p>
<p>
At that time Diogenes, the aide of Belisarius, made a display of
valorous deeds. For having been sent, together with twenty-two of the
body-guards, to spy upon their opponents, he came to a place two days'
journey distant from Carthage. And the farmers of the place, being
unable to kill these men, reported to Gelimer that they were there.
And he chose out and sent against them three hundred horsemen of the
Vandals, enjoining upon them to bring all the men alive before him.
For it seemed to him a most remarkable achievement to make captive a
personal aide of Belisarius with twenty-two body-guards. Now Diogenes
and his party had entered a certain house and were sleeping in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxiii_9" id="PageIII_xxiii_9">[9-16]</a></span>
the upper storey, having no thought of the enemy in mind, since,
indeed, they had learned that their opponents were far away. But the
Vandals, coming there at early dawn, thought it would not be to their
advantage to destroy the doors of the house or to enter it in the
dark, fearing lest, being involved in a night encounter, they might
themselves destroy one another, and at the same time, if that should
happen, provide a way of escape for a large number of the enemy in the
darkness. But they did this because cowardice had paralyzed their
minds, though it would have been possible for them with no trouble, by
carrying torches or even without these, to catch their enemies in
their beds not only without weapons, but absolutely naked besides. But
as it was, they made a phalanx in a circle about the whole house and
especially at the doors, and all took their stand there. But in the
meantime it so happened that one of the Roman soldiers was roused from
sleep, and he, noticing the noise which the Vandals made as they
talked stealthily among themselves and moved with their weapons, was
able to comprehend what was being done, and rousing each one of his
comrades silently, he told them what was going on. And they, following
the opinion of Diogenes, all put on their clothes quietly and taking
up their weapons went below. There they put the bridles on their
horses and leaped upon them unperceived by anyone. And after standing
for a time by the court-yard entrance, they suddenly opened the door
there, and straightway all came out. And then the Vandals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxiii_16" id="PageIII_xxiii_16">[16-1]</a></span>
immediately closed with them, but they accomplished nothing. For
the Romans rode hard, covering themselves with their shields and
warding off their assailants with their spears. And in this way
Diogenes escaped the enemy, losing two of his followers, but saving
the rest. He himself, however, received three blows in this encounter
on the neck and the face, from which indeed he came within a little of
dying, and one blow also on the left hand, as a result of which he was
thereafter unable to move his little finger. This, then, took place in
this way.</p>
<p>
And Belisarius offered great sums of money to the artisans engaged in
the building trade and to the general throng of workmen, and by this
means he dug a trench deserving of great admiration about the
circuit-wall, and setting stakes close together along it he made an
excellent stockade about the fortifications. And not only this, but he
built up in a short time the portions of the wall which had suffered,
a thing which seemed worthy of wonder not only to the Carthaginians,
but also to Gelimer himself at a later time. For when he came as a
captive to Carthage, he marvelled when he saw the wall and said that
his own negligence had proved the cause of all his present troubles.
This, then, was accomplished by Belisarius while in Carthage.</p>
<p>
XXIV</p>
<p>
But Tzazon, the brother of Gelimer, reached Sardinia with the
expedition which has been mentioned above<a name="FNanchor_61_III" id="FNanchor_61_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_III" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
 and disembarked at the
harbour of Caranalis<a name="FNanchor_62_III" id="FNanchor_62_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_III" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
; and at the first onset he captured the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxiv_1" id="PageIII_xxiv_1">[1-9]</a></span>
city and killed the tyrant Godas and all the fighting men about him.
And when he heard that the emperor's expedition was in the land of
Libya, having as yet learned nothing of what had been done there, he
wrote to Gelimer as follows: "Know, O King of the Vandals and Alani,
that the tyrant Godas has perished, having fallen into our hands, and
that the island is again under thy kingdom, and celebrate the festival
of triumph. And as for the enemy who have had the daring to march
against our land, expect that their attempt will come to the same fate
as that experienced by those who in former times marched against our
ancestors." And those who took this letter sailed into the harbour of
Carthage with no thought of the enemy in mind. And being brought by
the guards before the general, they put the letter into his hands and
gave him information on the matters about which he enquired, being
thunderstruck at what they beheld and awed at the suddenness of the
change; however, they suffered nothing unpleasant at the hand of
Belisarius.</p>
<p>
At this same time another event also occurred as follows. A short time
before the emperor's expedition reached Libya, Gelimer had sent envoys
into Spain, among whom were Gothaeus and Fuscias, in order to persuade
Theudis, the ruler of the Visigoths,<a name="FNanchor_63_III" id="FNanchor_63_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_III" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
 to establish an alliance with
the Vandals. And these envoys, upon disembarking on the mainland after
crossing the strait at Gadira, found Theudis in a place situated far
from the sea. And when they had come up to the place where he was,
Theudis received them with friendliness and entertained them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxiv_9" id="PageIII_xxiv_9">[9-19]</a></span>
heartily, and during the feast he pretended to enquire how matters
stood with Gelimer and the Vandals. Now since these envoys had
travelled to him rather slowly, it happened that he had heard from
others everything which had befallen the Vandals. For one merchant
ship sailing for trade had put out from Carthage on the very same day
as the army marched into the city, and finding a favouring wind, had
come to Spain. From those on this ship Theudis learned all that had
happened in Libya, but he forbade the merchants to reveal it to
anyone, in order that this might not become generally known. And when
Gothaeus and his followers replied that everything was as well as
possible for them, he asked them for what purpose, then, they had
come. And when they proposed the alliance, Theudis bade them go to the
sea-coast; "For from there," he said, "you will learn of the affairs
at home with certainty." And the envoys, supposing that the man was in
his cups and his words were not sane, remained silent. But when on the
following day they met him and made mention of the alliance, and
Theudis used the same words a second time, then at length they
understood that some change of fortune had befallen them in Libya, but
never once thinking of Carthage they sailed for the city. And upon
coming to land close by it and happening upon Roman soldiers, they put
themselves in their hands to do with them as they wished. And from
there they were led away to the general, and reporting the whole
story, they suffered no harm at his hand. These things, then, happened
thus. And Cyril,<a name="FNanchor_64_III" id="FNanchor_64_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_III" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
 upon coming near to Sardinia and learning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxiv_19" id="PageIII_xxiv_19">[19-7]</a></span>
what had happened to Godas, sailed to Carthage, and there, finding the
Roman army and Belisarius victorious, he remained at rest; and
Solomon<a name="FNanchor_65_III" id="FNanchor_65_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_III" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
 was sent to the emperor in order to announce what had been
accomplished.</p>
<p>
XXV</p>
<p>
But Gelimer, upon reaching the plain of Boulla, which is distant from
Carthage a journey of four days for an unencumbered traveller, not far
from the boundaries of Numidia, began to gather there all the Vandals
and as many of the Moors as happened to be friendly to him. Few Moors,
however, joined his alliance, and these were altogether insubordinate.
For all those who ruled over the Moors in Mauretania and Numidia and
Byzacium sent envoys to Belisarius saying that they were slaves of the
emperor and promised to fight with him. There were some also who even
furnished their children as hostages and requested that the symbols of
office be sent them from him according to the ancient custom. For it
was a law among the Moors that no one should be a ruler over them,
even if he was hostile to the Romans, until the emperor of the Romans
should give him the tokens of the office. And though they had already
received them from the Vandals, they did not consider that the Vandals
held the office securely. Now these symbols are a staff of silver
covered with gold, and a silver cap,&mdash;not covering the whole head, but
like a crown and held in place on all sides by bands of silver,&mdash;a
kind of white cloak gathered by a golden brooch on the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxv_7" id="PageIII_xxv_7">[7-15]</a></span>
shoulder in the form of a Thessalian cape, and a white tunic with
embroidery, and a gilded boot. And Belisarius sent these things to
them, and presented each one of them with much money. However, they
did not come to fight along with him, nor, on the other hand, did they
dare give their support to the Vandals, but standing out of the way of
both contestants, they waited to see what would be the outcome of the
war. Thus, then, matters stood with the Romans.</p>
<p>
But Gelimer sent one of the Vandals to Sardinia with a letter to his
brother Tzazon. And he went quickly to the coast, and finding by
chance a merchant-ship putting out to sea, he sailed into the harbour
of Caranalis and put the letter into the hands of Tzazon. Now the
message of the letter was as follows:</p>
<p>
"It was not, I venture to think, Godas who caused the island to revolt
from us, but some curse of madness sent from Heaven which fell upon
the Vandals. For by depriving us of you and the notables of the
Vandals, it has seized and carried off from the house of Gizeric
absolutely all the blessings which we enjoyed. For it was not to
recover the island for us that you sailed from here, but in order that
Justinian might be master of Libya. For that which Fortune had decided
upon previously it is now possible to know from the outcome.
Belisarius, then, has come against us with a small army, but valour
straightway departed and fled from the Vandals, taking good fortune
with her. For Ammatas and Gibamundus have fallen, because the Vandals
lost their courage, and the horses and shipyards and all Libya and,
not least of all, Carthage itself, are held already by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxv_15" id="PageIII_xxv_15">[15-23]</a></span>
enemy. And the Vandals are sitting here, having paid with their
children and wives and all their possessions for their failure to play
the part of brave men in battle, and to us is left only the plain of
Boulla, where our hope in you has set us down and still keeps us. But
do you have done with such matters as rebel tyrants and Sardinia and
the cares concerning these things, and come to us with your whole
force as quickly as possible. For when men find the very heart and
centre of all in danger, it is not advisable for them to consider
minutely other matters. And struggling hereafter in common against the
enemy, we shall either recover our previous fortune, or gain the
advantage of not bearing apart from each other the hard fate sent by
Heaven."</p>
<p>
When this letter had been brought to Tzazon, and he had disclosed its
contents to the Vandals, they turned to wailing and lamentation, not
openly, however, but concealing their feelings as much as possible and
avoiding the notice of the islanders, silently among themselves they
bewailed the fate which was upon them. And straightway setting in
order matters in hand just as chance directed, they manned the ships.
And sailing from there with the whole fleet, on the third day they
came to land at the point of Libya which marks the boundary between
the Numidians and Mauretanians. And they reached the plain of Boulla
travelling on foot, and there joined with the rest of the army. And in
that place there were many most pitiable scenes among the Vandals,
which I, at least, could never relate as they deserve. For I think
that even if one of the enemy themselves had happened to be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIII_xxv_23" id="PageIII_xxv_23">[23-26]</a></span>
spectator at that time, he would probably have felt pity, in spite of
himself, for the Vandals and for human fortune. For Gelimer and Tzazon
threw their arms about each other's necks, and could not let go, but
they spoke not a word to each other, but kept wringing their hands and
weeping, and each one of the Vandals with Gelimer embraced one of
those who had come from Sardinia, and did the same thing. And they
stood for a long time as if grown together and found such comfort as
they could in this, and neither did the men of Gelimer think fit to
ask about Godas (for their present fortune had prostrated them and
caused them to reckon such things as had previously seemed to them
most important with those which were now utterly negligible), nor
could those who came from Sardinia bring themselves to ask about what
had happened in Libya. For the place was sufficient to permit them to
judge of what had come to pass. And indeed they did not make any
mention even of their own wives and children, knowing well that
whoever of theirs was not there had either died or fallen into the
hands of the enemy. Thus, then, did these things happen.</p>

Gelimer, seeing all the Vandals gathered together, led his army
against Carthage. And when they came close to it, they tore down a
portion of the aqueduct,&mdash;a structure well worth seeing&mdash;which
conducted water into the city, and after encamping for a time they
withdrew, since no one of the enemy came out against them. And going
about the country there they kept the roads under guard and thought
that in this way they were besieging Carthage; however, they did not
gather any booty, nor plunder the land, but took possession of it as
their own. And at the same time they kept hoping that there would be
some treason on the part of the Carthaginians themselves and such of
the Roman soldiers as followed the doctrine of Arius. They also sent
to the leaders of the Huns, and promising that they would have many
good things from the Vandals, entreated them to become their friends
and allies. Now the Huns even before this had not been well-disposed
toward the cause of the Romans, since they had not indeed come to them
willingly as allies (for they asserted that the Roman general Peter
had given an oath and then, disregarding what had been sworn, had thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_i_6" id="PageIV_i_6">[6-11]</a></span>
brought them to Byzantium), and accordingly they received the
words of the Vandals, and promised that when they should come to real
fighting they would turn with them against the Roman army. But
Belisarius had a suspicion of all this (for he had heard it from the
deserters), and also the circuit-wall had not as yet been completed
entirely, and for these reasons he did not think it possible for his
men to go out against the enemy for the present, but he was making his
preparations within as well as possible. And one of the Carthaginians,
Laurus by name, having been condemned on a charge of treason and
proved guilty by his own secretary, was impaled by Belisarius on a
hill before the city, and as a result of this the others came to feel
a sort of irresistible fear and refrained from attempts at treason.
And he courted the Massagetae with gifts and banquets and every other
manner of flattering attention every day, and thus persuaded them to
disclose to him what Gelimer had promised them on condition of their
turning traitors in the battle. And these barbarians said that they
had no enthusiasm for fighting, for they feared that, if the Vandals
were vanquished, the Romans would not send them back to their native
land, but they would be compelled to grow old and die right there in
Libya; and besides they were also concerned, they said, about the
booty, lest they be robbed of it. Then indeed Belisarius gave them
pledges that, if the Vandals should be conquered decisively, they
would be sent without the least delay to their homes with all their
booty, and thus he bound them by oaths in very truth to assist the
Romans with all zeal in carrying through the war.</p> <p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_i_12" id="PageIV_i_12">[12-18]</a></span>
And when all
things had been prepared by him in the best way possible, and the
circuit-wall had been already completed, he called together the whole
army and spoke as follows: "As for exhortation, fellow Romans, I do
not know that it is necessary to make any to you,&mdash;men who have
recently conquered the enemy so completely that Carthage here and the
whole of Libya is a possession of your valour, and for this reason you
will have no need of admonition that prompts to daring. For the
spirits of those who have conquered are by no means wont to be
overcome. But I think it not untimely to remind you of this one thing,
that, if you on the present occasion but prove equal to your own
selves in valour, straightway there will be an end for the Vandals of
their hopes, and for you of the battle. Hence there is every reason
why you should enter into this engagement with the greatest eagerness.
For ever sweet to men is toil coming to an end and reaching its close.
Now as for the host of the Vandals, let no one of you consider them.
For not by numbers of men nor by measure of body, but by valour of
soul, is war wont to be decided. And let the strongest motive which
actuates men come to your minds, namely, pride in past achievement.
For it is a shame, for those at least who have reason, to fall short
of one's own self and to be found inferior to one's own standard of
valour. For I know well that terror and the memory of misfortunes have
laid hold upon the enemy and compel them to become less brave, for the
one fills them with fear because of what has already happened, and the
other brushes aside their hope of success. For Fortune, once seen to
be bad, straightway enslaves the spirit of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_i_18" id="PageIV_i_18">[18-25]</a></span>
who have
fallen in her way. And I shall explain how the struggle involves for
you at the present time a greater stake than formerly. For in the
former battle the danger was, if things did not go well for us, that
we should not take the land of others; but now, if we do not win the
struggle, we shall lose the land which is our own. In proportion,
then, as it is easier to possess nothing than to be deprived of what
one has, just so now our fear touches our most vital concerns more
than before. And yet formerly we had the fortune to win the victory
with the infantry absent, but now, entering the battle with God
propitious and with our whole army, I have hopes of capturing the camp
of the enemy, men and all. Thus, then, having the end of the war ready
at hand, do not by reason of any negligence put it off to another
time, lest you be compelled to seek for the opportune moment after it
has run past us. For when the fortune of war is postponed, its nature
is not to proceed in the same manner as before, especially if the war
be prolonged by the will of those who are carrying it on. For Heaven
is accustomed to bring retribution always upon those who abandon the
good fortune which is present. But if anyone considers that the enemy,
seeing their children and wives and most precious possessions in our
hands, will be daring beyond reason and will incur risks beyond the
strength which they have, he does not think rightly. For an
overpowering passion springing up in the heart in behalf of what is
most precious is wont to diminish men's actual strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_i_25" id="PageIV_i_25">[25-6]</a></span>
and
does not allow them to make full use of their present opportunities.
Considering, then, all these things, it behooves you to go with great
contempt against the enemy."
</p>
<br /><p>II</p>
<p>

After such words of exhortation, Belisarius sent out all the horsemen
on the same day, except five hundred, and also the guardsmen and the
standard, which the Romans call "bandum,"<a name="FNanchor_1_IV" id="FNanchor_1_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_1_IV" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> entrusting them to John
the Armenian, and directing him to skirmish only, if opportunity
should arise. And he himself on the following day followed with the
infantry forces and the five hundred horsemen. And the Massagetae,
deliberating among themselves, decided, in order to seem in friendly
agreement with both Gelimer and Belisarius, neither to begin fighting
for the Romans nor to go over to the Vandals before the encounter, but
whenever the situation of one or the other army should be bad, then to
join the victors in their pursuit of the vanquished. Thus, then, had
this matter been decided upon by the barbarians. And the Roman army
came upon the Vandals encamped in Tricamarum, one hundred and fifty
stades distant from Carthage. So they both bivouacked there at a
considerable distance from one another. And when it was well on in the
night, a prodigy came to pass in the Roman camp as follows. The tips
of their spears were lighted with a bright fire and the points
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_ii_6" id="PageIV_ii_6">[6-12]</a></span>
of them seemed to be burning most vigorously. This was not seen by
many, but it filled with consternation the few who did see it, not
knowing how it would come out. And this happened to the Romans in
Italy again at a much later time. And at that time, since they knew by
experience, they believed it to be a sign of victory. But now, as I
have said, since this was the first time it had happened, they were
filled with consternation and passed the night in great fear.
</p>
<p>And on the following day Gelimer commanded the Vandals to place the
women and children and all their possessions in the middle of the
stockade, although it had not the character of a fort, and calling all
together, he spoke as follows: "It is not to gain glory, or to
retrieve the loss of empire alone, O fellow Vandals, that we are about
to fight, so that even if we wilfully played the coward and sacrificed
these our belongings we might possibly live, sitting at home and
keeping our own possessions; but you see, surely, that our fortunes
have come round to such a pass that, if we do not gain the mastery
over the enemy, we shall, if we perish, leave them as masters of these
our children and our wives and our land and all our possessions, while
if we survive, there will be added our own enslavement and to behold
all these enslaved; but if, indeed, we overcome our foes in the war,
we shall, if we live, pass our lives among all good things, or, after
the glorious ending of our lives, there will be left to our wives and
children the blessings of prosperity, while the name of the Vandals
will survive and their empire be preserved. For if it has ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_ii_12" id="PageIV_ii_12">[12-20]</a></span>
happened to any men to be engaged in a struggle for their all, we now
more than all others realize that we are entering the battle-line with
our hopes for all we have resting wholly upon ourselves. Not for our
bodies, then, is our fear, nor in death is our danger, but in being
defeated by the enemy. For if we lose the victory, death will be to
our advantage. Since, therefore, the case stands so, let no one of the
Vandals weaken, but let him proudly expose his body, and from shame at
the evils that follow defeat let him court the end of life. For when a
man is ashamed of that which is shameful, there is always present with
him a dauntless courage in the face of danger. And let no recollection
of the earlier battle come into your minds. For it was not by
cowardice on our part that we were defeated, but we tripped upon
obstacles interposed by fortune and were overthrown. Now it is not the
way of the tide of fortune to flow always in the same direction, but
every day, as a rule, it is wont to change about. In manliness it is
our boast that we surpass the enemy, and that in numbers we are much
superior; for we believe that we surpass them no less than tenfold.
And why shall I add that many and great are the incentives which, now
especially, urge us on to valour, naming the glory of our ancestors
and the empire which has been handed down to us by them? For in our
case that glory is obscured by our unlikeness to our kindred, while
the empire is bent upon fleeing from us as unworthy. And I pass over
in silence the wails of these poor women and the tears of our
children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_ii_20" id="PageIV_ii_20">[20-27]</a></span>
by which, as you see, I am now so deeply moved that I
am unable to prolong my discourse. But having said this one thing, I
shall stop,&mdash;that there will be for us no returning to these most
precious possessions if we do not gain the mastery over the enemy.
Remembering these things, shew yourselves brave men and do not bring
shame upon the fame of Gizeric."
</p>
<p>After speaking such words, Gelimer commanded his brother Tzazon to
deliver an exhortation separately to the Vandals who had come with him
from Sardinia. And he gathered them together a little apart from the
camp and spoke as follows: "For all the Vandals, fellow soldiers, the
struggle is in behalf of those things which you have just heard the
king recount, but for you, in addition to all the other
considerations, it so happens that you are vying with yourselves. For
you have recently been victorious in a struggle for the maintenance of
our rule, and you have recovered the island for the empire of the
Vandals; there is every reason, therefore, for you to make still
greater display of your valour. For those whose hazard involves the
greatest things must needs display the greatest zeal for warfare also.
Indeed, when men who struggle for the maintenance of their rule are
defeated, should it so happen, they have not failed in the most vital
part; but when men are engaged in battle for their all, surely their
very lives are influenced by the outcome of the struggle. And for the
rest, if you shew yourselves brave men at the present time, you will
thereby prove with certainty that the destruction<a name="FNanchor_2_IV" id="FNanchor_2_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_2_IV" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the tyrant
Godas was an achievement of valour on your part; but if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_ii_27" id="PageIV_ii_27">[27-2]</a></span>
 you
weaken now, you will be deprived of even the renown of those deeds, as
of something which does not belong to you at all. And yet, even apart
from this, it is reasonable to think that you will have an advantage
over the rest of the Vandals in this battle. For those who have failed
are dismayed by their previous fortune, while those who have
encountered no reverse enter the struggle with their courage
unimpaired. And this too, I think, will not be spoken out of season,
that if we conquer the enemy, it will be you who will win the credit
for the greatest part of the victory, and all will call you saviours
of the nation of the Vandals. For men who achieve renown in company
with those who have previously met with misfortune naturally claim the
better fortune as their own. Considering all these things, therefore,
I say that you should bid the women and children who are lamenting
their fate to take courage even now, should summon God to fight with
us, should go with enthusiasm against the enemy, and lead the way for
our compatriots into this battle."
</p><br />
<p>III</p>
<p>

After both Gelimer and Tzazon had spoken such exhortations, they led
out the Vandals, and at about the time of lunch, when the Romans were
not expecting them, but were preparing their meal, they were at hand
and arrayed themselves for battle along the bank of the stream. Now
the stream at that place is an ever-flowing one, to be sure, but its
volume is so small that it is not even given a special name by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_iii_2" id="PageIV_iii_2">[2-10]</a></span>
inhabitants of the place, but it is designated simply as a
brook. So the Romans came to the other bank of this river, after
preparing themselves as well as they could under the circumstances,
and arrayed themselves as follows. The left wing was held by Martinus
and Valerian, John, Cyprian, Althias, and Marcellus, and as many
others as were commanders of the foederati<a name="FNanchor_3_IV" id="FNanchor_3_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_3_IV" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; and the right was held
by Pappas, Barbatus, and Agan, and the others who commanded the
forces of cavalry. And in the centre John took his position, leading
the guards and spearmen of Belisarius and carrying the general's
standard. And Belisarius also came there at the opportune moment with
his five hundred horsemen, leaving the infantry behind advancing at a
walk. For all the Huns had been arrayed in another place, it being
customary for them even before this not to mingle with the Roman army
if they could avoid so doing, and at that time especially, since they
had in mind the purpose which has previously been explained,<a name="FNanchor_4_IV" id="FNanchor_4_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_4_IV" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> it was
not their wish to be arrayed with the rest of the army. Such, then,
was the formation of the Romans. And on the side of the Vandals,
either wing was held by the chiliarchs, and each one led the division
under him, while in the centre was Tzazon, the brother of Gelimer, and
behind him were arrayed the Moors. But Gelimer himself was going about
everywhere exhorting them and urging them on to daring. And the
command had been previously given to all the Vandals to use neither
spear nor any other weapon in this engagement except their swords.
</p>
<p>After a considerable time had passed and no one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_iii_10" id="PageIV_iii_10">[10-17]</a></span>
 began the
battle, John chose out a few of those under him by the advice of
Belisarius and crossing the river made an attack on the centre, where
Tzazon crowded them back and gave chase. And the Romans in flight came
into their own camp, while the Vandals in pursuit came as far as the
stream, but did not cross it. And once more John, leading out more of
the guardsmen of Belisarius, made a dash against the forces of Tzazon,
and again being repulsed from there, withdrew to the Roman camp. And a
third time with almost all the guards and spearmen of Belisarius he
took the general's standard and made his attack with much shouting and
a great noise. But since the barbarians manfully withstood them and
used only their swords, the battle became fierce, and many of the
noblest of the Vandals fell, and among them Tzazon himself, the
brother of Gelimer. Then at last the whole Roman army was set in
motion, and crossing the river they advanced upon the enemy, and the
rout, beginning at the centre, became complete; for each of the Roman
divisions turned to flight those before them with no trouble. And the
Massagetae, seeing this, according to their agreement among
themselves<a name="FNanchor_5_IV" id="FNanchor_5_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_5_IV" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> joined the Roman army in making the pursuit, but this
pursuit was not continued for a great distance. For the Vandals
entered their own camp quickly and remained quiet, while the Romans,
thinking that they would not be able to fight it out with them inside
the stockade, stripped such of the corpses as had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_iii_17" id="PageIV_iii_17">[17-26]</a></span>
 gold upon
them and retired to their own camp. And there perished in this battle,
of the Romans less than fifty, but of the Vandals about eight hundred.
</p>
<p>But Belisarius, when the infantry came up in the late afternoon, moved
as quickly as he could with the whole army and went against the camp
of the Vandals. And Gelimer, realising that Belisarius with his
infantry and the rest of his army was coming against him straightway,
without saying a word or giving a command leaped upon his horse and
was off in flight on the road leading to Numidia. And his kinsmen and
some few of his domestics followed him in utter consternation and
guarding with silence what was taking place. And for some time it
escaped the notice of the Vandals that Gelimer had run away, but when
they all perceived that he had fled, and the enemy were already
plainly seen, then indeed the men began to shout and the children
cried out and the women wailed. And they neither took with them the
money they had nor did they heed the laments of those dearest to them,
but every man fled in complete disorder just as he could. And the
Romans, coming up, captured the camp, money and all, with not a man in
it; and they pursued the fugitives throughout the whole night, killing
all the men upon whom they happened, and making slaves of the women
and children. And they found in this camp a quantity of wealth such as
has never before been found, at least in one place. For the Vandals
had plundered the Roman domain for a long time and had transferred
great amounts of money to Libya,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_iii_26" id="PageIV_iii_26">[26-3]</a></span>
and since their land was an
especially good one, nourishing abundantly with the most useful crops,
it came about that the revenue collected from the commodities produced
there was not paid out to any other country in the purchase of a food
supply, but those who possessed the land always kept for themselves
the income from it for the ninety-five years during which the Vandals
ruled Libya. And from this it resulted that their wealth, amounting to
an extraordinary sum, returned once more on that day into the hands of
the Romans.
<span class="sidenote">533 A.D.</span>

So this battle and the pursuit and the capture of the Vandals' camp
happened three months after the Roman army came to Carthage, at about
the middle of the last month, which the Romans call
"December."
</p><br />
<p>IV</p>
<p>

Then Belisarius, seeing the Roman army rushing about in confusion and
great disorder, was disturbed, being fearful throughout the whole
night lest the enemy, uniting by mutual agreement against him, should
do him irreparable harm. And if this thing had happened at that time
in any way at all, I believe that, not one of the Romans would have
escaped and enjoyed this booty. For the soldiers, being extremely poor
men, upon becoming all of a sudden masters of very great wealth and of
women both young and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_iv_3" id="PageIV_iv_3">[3-10]</a></span>
 extremely comely, were no longer able to
restrain their minds or to find any satiety in the things they had,
but were so intoxicated, drenched as they were by their present good
fortunes, that each one wished to take everything with him back to
Carthage. And they were going about, not in companies but alone or by
twos, wherever hope led them, searching out everything roundabout
among the valleys and the rough country and wherever there chanced to
be a cave or anything such as might bring them into danger or ambush.
For neither did fear of the enemy nor their respect for Belisarius
occur to them, nor indeed anything else at all except the desire for
spoils, and being overmastered by this they came to think lightly of
everything else. And Belisarius, taking note of all this, was at a
loss as to how he should handle the situation. But at daybreak he took
his stand upon a certain hill near the road, appealing to the
discipline which no longer existed and heaping reproaches upon all,
soldiers and officers alike. Then indeed, those who chanced to be
near, and especially those who were of the household of Belisarius,
sent the money and slaves which they had to Carthage with their
tentmates and messmates, and themselves came up beside the general and
gave heed to the orders given them.
</p>
<p>And he commanded John, the Armenian, with two hundred men to follow
Gelimer, and without slackening their speed either night or day to
pursue him, until they should take him living or dead. And he sent
word to his associates in Carthage to lead into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_iv_10" id="PageIV_iv_10">[10-19]</a></span>
 the city all
the Vandals who were sitting as suppliants in sanctuaries in the
places about the city, giving them pledges and taking away their
weapons, that they might not begin an uprising, and to keep them there
until he himself should come. And with those who were left he went
about everywhere and gathered the soldiers hastily, and to all the
Vandals he came upon he gave pledges for their safety. For it was no
longer possible to catch anyone of the Vandals except as a suppliant
in the sanctuaries. And from these he took away their weapons and sent
them, with soldiers to guard them, to Carthage, not giving them time
to unite against the Romans. And when everything was as well settled
as possible, he himself with the greater part of the army moved
against Gelimer with all speed. But John, after continuing the pursuit
five days and nights, had already come not far from Gelimer, and in
fact he was about to engage with him on the following day. But since
it was not fated that Gelimer should be captured by John, the
following obstacle was contrived by fortune. Among those pursuing with
John it happened that there was Uliaris, the aide of Belisarius. Now
this man was a passionate fellow and well favoured in strength of
heart and body, but not a very serious man, but one who generally took
delight in wine and buffoonery. This Uliaris on the sixth day of the
pursuit, being drunk, saw a bird sitting in a tree at about sunrise,
and he quickly stretched his bow and despatched a missile at the bird.
And he missed the bird, but John, who was behind it, he hit in the
neck by no will of his own. And since the wound was mortal, John
passed away a short time afterwards, leaving great sorrow at his loss
to the Emperor Justinian and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_iv_19" id="PageIV_iv_19">[19-27]</a></span>
 Belisarius, the general, and to
all the Romans and Carthaginians. For in manliness and every sort of
virtue he was well endowed, and he shewed himself, to those who
associated with him, gentle and equitable to a degree quite
unsurpassed. Thus, then, John fulfilled his destiny. As for Uliaris,
when he came to himself, he fled to a certain village which was near
by and sat as a suppliant in the sanctuary there. And the soldiers no
longer pressed the pursuit of Gelimer, but they cared for John as long
as he survived, and when he had died they carried out all the
customary rites in his burial, and reporting the whole matter to
Belisarius they remained where they were. And as soon as he heard of
it, he came to John's burial, and bewailed his fate. And after weeping
over him and grieving bitterly at the whole occurrence, he honoured
the tomb of John with many gifts and especially by providing for it a
regular income. However, he did nothing severe to Uliaris, since the
soldiers said that John had enjoined upon them by the most dread oaths
that no vengeance should come to him, since he had not performed the
unholy deed with deliberate intent.
</p>
<p>Thus, then, Gelimer escaped falling into the hands of the enemy on
that day. And from that time on Belisarius pursued him, but upon
reaching a strong city of Numidia situated on the sea, ten days
distant from Carthage, which they call Hippo Regius,<a name="FNanchor_6_IV" id="FNanchor_6_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_6_IV" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he learned
that Gelimer had ascended the mountain Papua and could no longer be
captured by the Romans. Now this mountain is situated at the extremity
of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_iv_27" id="PageIV_iv_27">[27-32]</a></span>
 Numidia and is exceedingly precipitous and climbed only with
the greatest difficulty (for lofty cliffs rise up toward it from every
side), and on it dwell barbarian Moors, who were friends and allies to
Gelimer, and an ancient city named Medeus lies on the outskirts of the
mountain. There Gelimer rested with his followers. But as for
Belisarius, he was not able to make any attempt at all on the
mountain, much less in the winter season, and since his affairs were
still in an uncertain state, he did not think it advisable to be away
from Carthage; and so he chose out soldiers, with Pharas as their
leader, and set them to maintain the siege of the mountain. Now this
Pharas was energetic and thoroughly serious and upright in every way,
although he was an Erulian by birth. And for an Erulian not to give
himself over to treachery and drunkenness, but to strive after
uprightness, is no easy matter and merits
abundant praise.<a name="FNanchor_7_IV" id="FNanchor_7_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_7_IV" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
But not
only was it Pharas who maintained orderly conduct, but also all the
Erulians who followed him. This Pharas, then, Belisarius commanded to
establish himself at the foot of the mountain during the winter season
and to keep close guard, so that it would neither be possible for
Gelimer to leave the mountain nor for any supplies to be brought in to
him. And Pharas acted accordingly. Then Belisarius turned to the
Vandals who were sitting as suppliants in the sanctuaries in Hippo
Regius,&mdash;and there were many of them and of the nobility&mdash;and he
caused them all to accept pledges and arise, and then he sent them to
Carthage with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_iv_32" id="PageIV_iv_32">[32-38]</a></span>
 guard. And there it came about that the
following event happened to him.
</p>
<p>
In the house of Gelimer there was a certain scribe named Boniface, a
Libyan, and a native of Byzacium, a man exceedingly faithful to
Gelimer. At the beginning of this war Gelimer had put this Boniface on
a very swift-sailing ship, and placing all the royal treasure in it
commanded him to anchor in the harbour of Hippo Regius, and if he
should see that the situation was not favourable to their side, he was
to sail with all speed to Spain with the money, and go to Theudis, the
leader of the Visigoths, where he was expecting to find safety for
himself also, should the fortune of war prove adverse for the Vandals.
So Boniface, as long as he felt hope for the cause of the Vandals,
remained there; but as soon as the battle in Tricamarum took place,
with all the other events which have been related, he spread his
canvas and sailed away just as Gelimer had directed him. But an
opposing wind brought him back, much against his will, into the
harbour of Hippo Regius. And since he had already heard that the enemy
were somewhere near, he entreated the sailors with many promises to
row with all their might for some other continent or for an island.
But they were unable to do so, since a very severe storm had fallen
upon them and the waves of the sea were rising to a great height,
seeing that it was
the Tuscan sea,<a name="FNanchor_8_IV" id="FNanchor_8_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_8_IV" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and then it occurred to them and
to Boniface that, after all, God wished to give the money to the
Romans and so was not allowing the ship to put out. However, though
they had got outside the harbour, they encountered great danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_iv_38" id="PageIV_iv_38">[38-3]</a></span>
in bringing their ship back to anchorage. And when Belisarius arrived
at Hippo Regius, Boniface sent some men to him. These he commanded to
sit in a sanctuary, and they were to say that they had been sent by
Boniface, who had the money of Gelimer, but to conceal the place where
he was, until they should receive the pledges of Belisarius that upon
giving Gelimer's money lie himself should escape free from harm,
having all that was his own. These men, then, acted according to these
instructions, and Belisarius was pleased at the good news and did not
decline to take an oath. And sending some of his associates he took
the treasure of Gelimer and released Boniface in possession of his own
money and also with an enormous sum which he plundered from Gelimer's
treasure.
</p><br />
<p>V</p>
<p>

And when he returned to Carthage, he put all the Vandals in readiness,
so that at the opening of spring he might send them to Byzantium; and
he sent out an army to recover for the Romans everything which the
Vandals ruled. And first he sent Cyril to Sardinia with a great force,
having the head of Tzazon, since these islanders were not at all
willing to yield to the Romans, fearing the Vandals and thinking that
what had been told them as having happened in Tricamarum could not be
true. And he ordered this Cyril to send a portion of the army to
Corsica, and to recover for the Roman empire the island, which had
been previously subject to the Vandals; this island was called Cyrnus
in early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_v_3" id="PageIV_v_3">[3-10]</a></span>
 times, and is not far from Sardinia. So he came to
Sardinia and displayed the head of Tzazon to the inhabitants of the
place, and he won back both the islands and made them tributary to the
Roman domain. And to Caesarea<a name="FNanchor_9_IV" id="FNanchor_9_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_9_IV" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in Mauretania Belisarius sent John
with an infantry company which he usually commanded himself; this
place is distant from Carthage a journey of thirty days for an
unencumbered traveller, as one goes towards Gadira and the west; and
it is situated upon the sea, having been a great and populous city
from ancient times. Another John, one of his own guardsmen, he sent to
Gadira on the strait and by one of the Pillars of Heracles, to take
possession of the fort there which they call "Septem."<a name="FNanchor_10_IV" id="FNanchor_10_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_10_IV" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And to the
islands which are near the strait where the ocean flows in, called
Ebusa and Majorica and Minorica<a name="FNanchor_11_IV" id="FNanchor_11_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_11_IV" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> by the natives, he sent
Apollinarius, who was a native of Italy, but had come while still a
lad to Libya. And he had been rewarded with great sums of money by
Ilderic, who was then leader of the Vandals, and after Ilderic had
been removed from the office and was in confinement, as has been told
in the previous narrative,<a name="FNanchor_12_IV" id="FNanchor_12_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_12_IV" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> he came to the Emperor Justinian with
the other Libyans who were working in the interest of Ilderic, in
order to entreat his favour as a suppliant. And he joined the Roman
expedition against Gelimer and the Vandals, and proved himself a brave
man in this war and most of all at Tricamarum. And as a result of his
deeds there Belisarius entrusted to him these islands. And later
Belisarius sent an army also into Tripolis to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_v_10" id="PageIV_v_10">[10-15]</a></span>
 Pudentius and
Tattimuth,<a name="FNanchor_13_IV" id="FNanchor_13_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_13_IV" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who were being pressed by the Moors there, and thus
strengthened the Roman power in that quarter.
</p>
<p>He also sent some men to Sicily in order to take the fortress in
Lilybaeum, as belonging to the Vandals' kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_14_IV" id="FNanchor_14_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_14_IV" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but he was
repulsed from there, since the Goths by no means saw fit to yield any
part of Sicily, on the ground that this fortress did not belong to the
Vandals at all. And when Belisarius heard this, he wrote to the
commanders who were there as follows: "You are depriving us of
Lilybaeum, the fortress of the Vandals who are the slaves of the
emperor, and are not acting justly nor in a way to benefit yourselves,
and you wish to bring upon your ruler, though he does not so will it
and is far distant from the scene of these actions, the hostility of
the great emperor, whose good-will he has, having won it with great
labour. And yet how could you but seem to be acting contrary to the
ways of men, it you recently allowed Gelimer to hold the fortress, but
have decided to wrest from the emperor, Gelimer's master, the
possessions of the slave? You, at least, should not act thus, most
excellent sirs. But reflect that, while it is the nature of friendship
to cover over many faults, hostility does not brook even the smallest
misdeeds, but searches the past for every offence, and allows not its
enemy to grow rich on what does not in the least belong to them.<a name="FNanchor_15_IV" id="FNanchor_15_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_15_IV" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_v_15" id="PageIV_v_15">[15-23]</a></span>
the enemy fights to avenge the wrongs which it says
have been done to its ancestors; and whereas, if friendship thus
turned to hostility fails in the struggle, it suffers no loss of its
own possessions, yet if it succeeds, it teaches the vanquished to take
a new view of the indulgence which has been shewn them in the past.
See to it, then, that you neither do us further harm nor suffer harm
yourselves, and do not make the great emperor an enemy to the Gothic
nation, when it is your prayer that he be propitious toward you. For
be well assured that, if you lay claim to this fortress, war will
confront you immediately, and not for Lilybaeum alone, but for all the
possessions you claim as yours, though not one of them belongs to
you."</p> <p>Such was the message of the letter. And the Goths reported these
things to the mother<a name="FNanchor_16_IV" id="FNanchor_16_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_16_IV" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of Antalaric, and at her direction made the
following reply: "The letter which you have written, most excellent
Belisarius, carries sound admonition, but pertinent to some other men,
not to us the Goths. For there is nothing of the Emperor Justinian's
which we have taken and hold; may we never be so mad as to do such a
thing! The whole of Sicily we claim because it is our own, and the
fortress of Lilybaeum is one of its promontories. And if Theoderic
gave his sister, who was the consort of the king of the Vandals, one
of the trading-ports of Sicily for her use, this is nothing. For this
fact could not afford a basis for any claim on your part. But you, O
General, would be acting justly toward us, if you should be willing to
make the settlement of the matters in dispute between us, not as an
enemy, but as a friend. And there is this difference, that friends

<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_v_23" id="PageIV_v_23">[23-3]</a></span>
are accustomed to settle their disagreements by arbitration,
but enemies by battle. We, therefore, shall commit this matter to the
Emperor Justinian, to arbitrate<a name="FNanchor_17_IV" id="FNanchor_17_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_17_IV" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in whatever manner seems to him
lawful and just. And we desire that the decisions you make shall be as
wise as possible, rather than as hasty as possible, and that you,
therefore, await the decision of your emperor." Such was the message
of the letter of the Goths. And Belisarius, reporting all to the
emperor, remained quiet until the emperor should send him word what
his wish was.
</p><br />
<p>VI</p>
<p>

But Pharas, having by this time become weary of the siege for many
reasons, and especially because of the winter season, and at the same
time thinking that the Moors there would not be able to stand in his
way, undertook the ascent of Papua with great zeal. Accordingly he
armed all his followers very carefully and began the ascent. But the
Moors rushed to the defence, and since they were on ground which was
steep and very hard to traverse, their efforts to hinder those making
the ascent were easily accomplished. But Pharas fought hard to force
the ascent, and one hundred and ten of his men perished in this
struggle, and he himself with the remainder was beaten back and
retired; and as a result of this he did not dare to attempt the ascent
again, since the situation was against him, but he established as
careful a guard as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_vi_3" id="PageIV_vi_3">[3-10]</a></span>
 possible, in order that those on Papua,
being pressed by hunger, might surrender themselves; and he neither
permitted them to run away nor anything to be brought in to them from
outside. Then, indeed, it came about that Gelimer and those about him,
who were nephews and cousins of his and other persons of high birth,
experienced a misery which no one could describe, however eloquent he
might be, in a way which would equal the facts. For of all the nations
which we know that of the Vandals is the most luxurious, and that of
the Moors the most hardy. For the Vandals, since the time when they
gained possession of Libya, used to indulge in baths, all of them,
every day, and enjoyed a table abounding in all things, the sweetest
and best that the earth and sea produce. And they wore gold very
generally, and clothed themselves in the Medic garments, which now
they call "seric,"<a name="FNanchor_18_IV" id="FNanchor_18_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_18_IV" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and passed their time, thus dressed, in
theatres and hippodromes and in other pleasureable pursuits, and above
all else in hunting. And they had dancers and mimes and all other
things to hear and see which are of a musical nature or otherwise
merit attention among men. And the most of them dwelt in parks, which
were well supplied with water and trees; and they had great numbers of
banquets, and all manner of sexual pleasures were in great vogue among
them. But the Moors live in stuffy huts<a name="FNanchor_19_IV" id="FNanchor_19_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_19_IV" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> both in winter and in
summer and at every other time, never removing from them either
because of snow or the heat of the sun or any other discomfort
whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_vi_10" id="PageIV_vi_10">[10-20]</a></span>
 due to nature. And they sleep on the ground, the
prosperous among them, if it should so happen, spreading a fleece
under themselves. Moreover, it is not customary among them to change
their clothing with the seasons, but they wear a thick cloak and a
rough shirt at all times. And they have neither bread nor wine nor any
other good thing, but they take grain, either wheat or barley, and,
without boiling it or grinding it to flour or barley-meal, they eat it
in a manner not a whit different from that of animals. Since the
Moors, then, were of a such a sort, the followers of Gelimer, after
living with them for a long time and changing their accustomed manner
of life to such a miserable existence, when at last even the
necessities of life had failed, held out no longer, but death was
thought by them most sweet and slavery by no means disgraceful.
</p>
<p>Now when this was learned by Pharas, he wrote to Gelimer as follows:
"I too am a barbarian and not accustomed to writing and speaking, nor
am I skilful in these matters. But that which I am forced as a man to
know, having learned from the nature of things, this I am writing you.
What in the world has happened to you, my dear Gelimer, that you have
cast, not yourself alone, but your whole family besides, into this
pit? Is it, forsooth, that you may avoid becoming a slave? But this is
assuredly nothing but youthful folly, and making of 'liberty' a mere
shibboleth, as though liberty were worth possessing at the price of
all this misery! And, after all, do you not consider that you are,
even now, a slave to the most wretched of the Moors, since your only
hope of being saved, if the best happens, is in them? And yet why
would it not be better in every way to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_vi_20" id="PageIV_vi_20">[20-26]</a></span>
 be a slave among the
Romans and beggared, than to be monarch on Mount Papua with Moors as
your subjects? But of course it seems to you the very height of
disgrace even to be a fellow slave with Belisarius! Away with the
thought, most excellent Gelimer. Are not we,<a name="FNanchor_20_IV" id="FNanchor_20_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_20_IV" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> who also are born of
noble families, proud that we are now in the service of an emperor?
And indeed they say that it is the wish of the Emperor Justinian to
have you enrolled in the senate, thus sharing in the highest honour
and being a patrician, as we term that rank, and to present you with
lands both spacious and good and with great sums of money, and that
Belisarius is willing to make himself responsible for your having all
these things, and to give you pledges. Now as for all the miseries
which fortune has brought you, you are able to bear with fortitude
whatever comes from her, knowing that you are but a man and that these
things are inevitable; but if fortune has purposed to temper these
adversities with some admixture of good, would you of yourself refuse
to accept this gladly? Or should we consider that the good gifts of
fortune are not just as inevitable as are her undesirable gifts? Yet
such is not the opinion of even the utterly senseless; but you, it
would seem, have now lost your good judgment, steeped as you are in
misfortunes. Indeed, discouragement is wont to confound the mind and
to be transformed to folly. If, however, you can bear your own
thoughts and refrain from rebelling against fortune when she changes,
it will be possible at this very moment for you to choose that which
will be wholly to your advantage, and to escape from the evils which
hang over you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_vi_27" id="PageIV_vi_27">[27-34]</a></span>
When Gelimer had read this letter and wept
bitterly over it, he wrote in reply as follows: "I am both deeply
grateful to you for the advice which you have given me and I also
think it unbearable to be a slave to an enemy who wrongs me, from whom
I should pray God to exact justice, if He should be propitious to
me,&mdash;an enemy who, though he had never experienced any harm from me
either in deeds which he suffered or in words which he heard, provided
a pretext for a war which was unprovoked, and reduced me to this state
of misfortune, bringing Belisarius against me from I know not where.
And yet it is not at all unlikely that he also, since he is but a man,
though he be emperor too, may have something befall him which he would
not choose. But as for me, I am not able to write further. For my
present misfortune has robbed me of my thoughts. Farewell, then, dear
Pharas, and send me a lyre and one loaf of bread and a sponge, I pray
you." When this reply was read by Pharas, he was at a loss for some
time, being unable to understand the final words of the letter, until
he who had brought the letter explained that Gelimer desired one loaf
because he was eager to enjoy the sight of it and to eat it, since
from the time when he went up upon Papua he had not seen a single
baked loaf. A sponge also was necessary for him; for one of his eyes,
becoming irritated by lack of washing, was greatly swollen. And being
a skilful harpist he had composed an ode relating to his present
misfortune, which he was eager to chant to the accompaniment of a lyre
while he wept out his soul. When Pharas heard this, he was deeply
moved, and lamenting the fortune of men, he did as was written and
sent all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_vi_34" id="PageIV_vi_34">[34-5]</a></span>
 the things which Gelimer desired of him. However he
relaxed the siege not a whit, but kept watch more closely than before.
</p><br />
<p>VII</p>
<p>

And already a space of three months had been spent in this siege and
the winter was coming to an end. And Gelimer was afraid, suspecting
that his besiegers would come up against him after no great time; and
the bodies of most of the children who were related to him<a name="FNanchor_21_IV" id="FNanchor_21_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_21_IV" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> were
discharging worms in this time of misery. And though in everything he
was deeply distressed, and looked upon everything,&mdash;except, indeed,
death,&mdash;with dissatisfaction, he nevertheless endured the suffering
beyond all expectation, until it happened that he beheld a sight such
as the following. A certain Moorish woman had managed somehow to crush
a little corn, and making of it a very tiny cake, threw it into the
hot ashes on the hearth. For thus it is the custom among the Moors to
bake their loaves. And beside this hearth two children were sitting,
in exceedingly great distress by reason of their hunger, the one being
the son of the very woman who had thrown in the cake, and the other a
nephew of Gelimer; and they were eager to seize the cake as soon as it
should seem to them to be cooked. And of the two children the Vandal
got ahead of the other and snatched the cake first, and, though it was
still exceedingly hot and covered with ashes, hunger overpowered him,
and he threw it into his mouth and was eating it, when the other
seized him by the hair of the head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_vii_5" id="PageIV_vii_5">[5-11]</a></span>
 and struck him over the
temple and beat him again and thus compelled him with great violence
to cast out the cake which was already in his throat. This sad
experience Gelimer could not endure (for he had followed all from the
beginning), and his spirit was weakened and he wrote as quickly as
possible to Pharas as follows: "If it has ever happened to any man,
after manfully enduring terrible misfortunes, to take a course
contrary to that which he had previously determined upon, consider me
to be such a one, O most excellent Pharas. For there has come to my
mind your advice, which I am far from wishing to disregard. For I
cannot resist fortune further nor rebel against fate, but I shall
follow straightway wherever it seems to her best to lead; but let me
receive the pledges, that Belisarius guarantees that the emperor will
do everything which you recently promised me. For I, indeed, as soon
as you give the pledges, shall put both myself into your hands and
these kinsmen of mine and the Vandals, as many as are here with us."
</p>
<p>Such were the words written by Gelimer in this letter. And Pharas,
having signified this to Belisarius, as well as what they had
previously written to each other, begged him to declare as quickly as
possible what his wish was. And Belisarius (since he was greatly
desirous of leading Gelimer alive to the emperor), as soon as he had
read the letter, became overjoyed and commanded Cyprian, a leader of
foederati,<a name="FNanchor_22_IV" id="FNanchor_22_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_22_IV" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> to go to Papua with certain others, and directed them
to give an oath concerning the safety of Gelimer and of those with
him, and to swear that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_vii_11" id="PageIV_vii_11">[11-17]</a></span>
 he would be honoured before the emperor
and would lack nothing. And when these men had come to Pharas, they
went with him to a certain place by the foot of the mountain, where
Gelimer came at their summons, and after receiving the pledges just as
he wished he came with them to Carthage. And it happened that
Belisarius was staying for a time in the suburb of the city which they
call Adas. Accordingly Gelimer came before him in that place, laughing
with such laughter as was neither moderate nor the kind one could
conceal, and some of those who were looking at him suspected that by
reason of the extremity of his affliction he had changed entirely from
his natural state and that, already beside himself, he was laughing
for no reason. But his friends would have it that the man was in his
sound mind, and that because he had been born in a royal family, and
had ascended the throne, and had been clothed with great power and
immense wealth from childhood even to old age, and then being driven
to flight and plunged into great fear had undergone the sufferings on
Papua, and now had come as a captive, having in this way had
experience of all the gifts of fortune, both good and evil, for this
reason, they believed, he thought that man's lot was worthy of nothing
else than much laughter. Now concerning this laughter of Gelimer's,
let each one speak according to his judgment, both enemy and friend.
But Belisarius, reporting to the emperor that Gelimer was a captive in
Carthage, asked permission to bring him to Byzantium with him. At the
same time he guarded both him and all the Vandals in no dishonour and
proceeded to put the fleet in readiness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_vii_18" id="PageIV_vii_18">[18-2]</a></span>
Now many other things
too great to be hoped for have before now been experienced in the long
course of time, and they will continue as long as the fortunes of men
are the same as they now are; for those things which seem to reason
impossible are actually accomplished, and many times those things
which previously appeared impossible, when they have befallen, have
seemed to be worthy of wonder; but whether such events as these ever
took place before I am not able to say, wherein the fourth descendant
of Gizeric, and his kingdom at the height of its wealth and military
strength, were completely undone in so short a time by five thousand
men coming in as invaders and having not a place to cast anchor. For
such was the number of the horsemen who followed Belisarius, and
carried through the whole war against the Vandals. For whether this
happened by chance or because of some kind of valour, one would justly
marvel at it. But I shall return to the point from which I have
strayed.
</p><br />
<p>VIII</p>
<p>

So the Vandalic war ended thus. But envy, as is wont to happen in
cases of great good fortune, was already swelling against Belisarius,
although he provided no pretext for it. For some of the officers
slandered him to the emperor, charging him, without any grounds
whatever, with seeking to set up a kingdom for himself,<a name="FNanchor_23_IV" id="FNanchor_23_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_23_IV" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> a
statement for which there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_viii_2" id="PageIV_viii_2">[2-10]</a></span>
 was no basis whatever. But the
emperor did not disclose these things to the world, either because he
paid no heed to the slander, or because this course seemed better to
him. But he sent Solomon and gave Belisarius the opportunity to choose
whichever of two things he desired, either to come to Byzantium with
Gelimer and the Vandals, or to remain there and send them. And
Belisarius, since it did not escape him that the officers were
bringing against him the charge of seeking supreme power, was eager to
get to Byzantium, in order that he might clear himself of the charge
and be able to proceed against his slanderers. Now as to the manner in
which he learned of the attempt of his accusers, I shall explain. When
those who denounced him wished to present this slander, fearing lest
the man who was to carry their letter to the emperor should be lost at
sea and thus put a stop to their proceedings, they wrote the aforesaid
accusation on two tablets, purposing to send two messengers to the
emperor in two ships. And one of these two sailed away without being
detected, but the second, on account of some suspicion or other, was
captured in Mandracium, and putting the writing into the hands of his
captors, he made known what was being done. So Belisarius, having
learned in this way, was eager to come before the emperor, as has been
said. Such, then, was the course of these events at Carthage.
</p>
<p>But the Moors who dwelt in Byzacium and in Numidia turned to revolt
for no good reason, and they decided to break the treaty and to rise
suddenly against the Romans. And this was not out of keeping with
their peculiar character. For there is among the Moors neither fear of
God nor respect for men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_viii_10" id="PageIV_viii_10">[10-17]</a></span>
For they care not either for oaths or
for hostages, even though the hostages chance to be the children or
brothers of their leaders. Nor is peace maintained among the Moors by
any other means than by fear of the enemies opposing them. Now I shall
set forth in what manner the treaty was made by them with Belisarius
and how it was broken. When it came to be expected that the emperor's
expedition would arrive in Libya, the Moors, fearing lest they should
receive some harm from it, consulted the oracles of their women. For
it is not lawful in this nation for a man to utter oracles, but the
women among them as a result of some sacred rites become possessed and
foretell the future, no less than any of the ancient oracles. So on
that occasion, when they made enquiry, as has been said, the women
gave the response: "There shall be a host from the waters, the
overthrow of the Vandals, destruction and defeat of the Moors, when
the general of the Romans shall come unbearded." When the Moors heard
this, since they saw that the emperor's army had come from the sea,
they began to be in great fear and were quite unwilling to fight in
alliance with the Vandals, but they sent to Belisarius and established
peace, as has been stated previously,<a name="FNanchor_24_IV" id="FNanchor_24_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_24_IV" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and then remained quiet and
waited for the future, to see how it would fall out. And when the
power of the Vandals had now come to an end, they sent to the Roman
army, investigating whether there was anyone unbearded among them
holding an office. And when they saw all wearing full beards, they
thought that the oracle did not indicate the present time to them, but
one many generations later, interpreting the saying in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_viii_17" id="PageIV_viii_17">[17-25]</a></span>
 that way
which they themselves wished. Immediately, therefore, they were eager
to break the treaty, but their fear of Belisarius prevented them. For
they had no hope that they would ever overcome the Romans in war, at
least with him present. But when they heard that he was making his
departure together with his guards and spearmen, and that the ships
were already being filled with them and the Vandals, they suddenly
rose in arms and displayed every manner of outrage upon the Libyans.
For the soldiers were both few in each place on the frontier and still
unprepared, so that they would not have been able to stand against the
barbarians as they made inroads at every point, nor to prevent their
incursions, which took place frequently and not in an open manner. But
men were being killed indiscriminately and women with their children
were being made slaves, and the wealth was being plundered from every
part of the frontier and the whole country was being filled with
fugitives. These things were reported to Belisarius when he was just
about setting sail. And since it was now too late for him to return
himself, he entrusted Solomon with the administration of Libya and he
also chose out the greatest part of his own guards and spearmen,
instructing them to follow Solomon and as quickly as possible to
punish with all zeal those of the Moors who had risen in revolt and to
exact vengeance for the injury done the Romans. And the emperor sent
another army also to Solomon with Theodoras, the Cappadocian, and
Ildiger, who was the son-in-law of Antonina, the wife of Belisarius.
And since it was no longer possible to find the revenues of the
districts of Libya set down in order in documents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_viii_25" id="PageIV_viii_25">[25-4]</a></span>
as the
Romans had recorded them in former times,<a name="FNanchor_25_IV" id="FNanchor_25_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_25_IV" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> inasmuch as Gizeric had
upset and destroyed everything in the beginning, Tryphon and
Eustratius were sent by the emperor, in order to assess the taxes for
the Libyans each according to his proportion. But these men seemed to
the Libyans neither moderate nor endurable.
</p><br />
<p>IX</p>
<p>

Belisarius, upon reaching Byzantium with Gelimer and the Vandals, was
counted worthy to receive such honours, as in former times were
assigned to those generals of the Romans who had won the greatest and
most noteworthy victories. And a period of about six hundred years had
now passed since anyone had attained these honours,<a name="FNanchor_26_IV" id="FNanchor_26_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_26_IV" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> except,
indeed, Titus and Trajan, and such other emperors as had led armies
against some barbarian nation and had been victorious. For he
displayed the spoils and slaves from the war in the midst of the city
and led a procession which the Romans call a "triumph," not, however,
in the ancient manner, but going on foot from his own house to the
hippodrome and then again from the barriers until he reached the place
where the imperial throne is.<a name="FNanchor_27_IV" id="FNanchor_27_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_27_IV" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> And there was booty,&mdash;first of all,
whatever articles are wont
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_ix_4" id="PageIV_ix_4">[4-11]</a></span>
to be set apart for the royal
service,&mdash;thrones of gold and carriages in which it is customary for a
king's consort to ride, and much jewelry made of precious stones, and
golden drinking cups, and all the other things which are useful for
the royal table. And there was also silver weighing many thousands of
talents and all the royal treasure amounting to an exceedingly great
sum (for Gizeric had despoiled the Palatium in Rome, as has been said
in the preceding narrative),<a name="FNanchor_28_IV" id="FNanchor_28_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_28_IV" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
and among these were the treasures of
the Jews, which Titus, the son of Vespasian, together with certain
others, had brought to Rome after the capture of Jerusalem. And one of
the Jews, seeing these things, approached one of those known to the
emperor and said: "These treasures I think it inexpedient to carry
into the palace in Byzantium. Indeed, it is not possible for them to
be elsewhere than in the place where Solomon, the king of the Jews,
formerly placed them. For it is because of these that Gizeric captured
the palace of the Romans, and that now the Roman army has captured
that the Vandals." When this had been brought to the ears of the
Emperor, he became afraid and quickly sent everything to the
sanctuaries of the Christians in Jerusalem. And there were slaves in
the triumph, among whom was Gelimer himself, wearing some sort of a
purple garment upon his shoulders, and all his family, and as many of
the Vandals as were very tall and fair of body. And when Gelimer
reached the hippodrome and saw the emperor sitting upon a lofty seat
and the people standing on either side and realized as he looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_ix_11" id="PageIV_ix_11">[11-16]</a></span>
about in what an evil plight he was, he neither wept nor cried out,
but ceased not saying over in the
words of the Hebrew scripture<a name="FNanchor_29_IV" id="FNanchor_29_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_29_IV" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>:

"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." And when he came before the
emperor's seat, they stripped off the purple garment, and compelled
him to fall prone on the ground and do obeisance to the Emperor
Justinian. This also Belisarius did, as being a suppliant of the
emperor along with him. And the Emperor Justinian and the Empress
Theodora presented the children of Ilderic and his offspring and all
those of the family of the Emperor Valentinian with sufficient sums of
money, and to Gelimer they gave lands not to be despised in Galatia
and permitted him to live there together with his family. However,
Gelimer was by no means enrolled among the patricians, since he was
unwilling to change from the faith of Arius.</p>

A little later the triumph<a name="FNanchor_30_IV" id="FNanchor_30_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_30_IV" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> was celebrated by, Belisarius in the
ancient manner also. For he had the fortune to be advanced to the
office of consul, and therefore was borne aloft by the captives, and
as he was thus carried in his curule chair, he threw to the populace
those very spoils of the Vandalic war. For the people carried off the
silver plate and golden girdles and a vast amount of the Vandals'
wealth of other sorts as a result of Belisarius' consulship, and it
seemed that after a long interval of disuse an old custom was being
revived.<a name="FNanchor_31_IV" id="FNanchor_31_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_31_IV" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> These things, then, took place in Byzantium in the manner

<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_x_1" id="PageIV_x_1">[1-7]</a></span>
And Solomon took over the army in Libya; but in view of the fact that
the Moors had risen against him, as has been told previously, and that
everything was in suspense, he was at a loss how to treat the
situation. For it was reported that the barbarians had destroyed the
soldiers in Byzacium and Numidia and that they were pillaging and
plundering everything there. But what disturbed most of all both him
and all Carthage was the fate which befell Agan, the Massagete, and
Rufinus, the Thracian, in Byzacium. For both were men of great repute
both in the household of Belisarius and in the Roman army, one of
them, Agan, being among the spearmen of Belisarius, while the other,
as the most courageous of all, was accustomed to carry the standard of
the general in battle; such an officer the
Romans call "bandifer."<a name="FNanchor_32_IV" id="FNanchor_32_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_32_IV" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Now at the time referred to these two men were commanding detatchments
of cavalry in Byzacium, and when they saw the Moors plundering
everything before them and making all the Libyans captives, they
watched in a narrow pass with their followers for those who were
escorting the booty, and killed them and took away all the captives.
And when a report of this came to the commanders of the barbarians,
Coutzinas and Esdilasas and Iourphouthes and Medisinissas, who were
not far away from this pass, they moved against them with their whole
army in the late afternoon. And the Romans, being a very few men and
shut off in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_x_7" id="PageIV_x_7">[7-14]</a></span>
a narrow place in the midst of many thousands, were
not able to ward off their assailants. For wherever they might turn,
they were always shot at from the rear. Then, indeed, Rufinus and
Agan with some few men ran to the top of a rock which was near by and
from there defended themselves against the barbarians. Now as long as
they were using their bows, the enemy did not dare come directly to a
hand-to-hand struggle with them, but they kept hurling their javelins
among them; but when all the arrows of the Romans were now exhausted,
the Moors closed with them, and they defended themselves with their
swords as well as the circumstances permitted. But since they were
overpowered by the multitude of the barbarians, Agan fell there with
his whole body hacked to pieces, and Rufinus was seized by the enemy
and led away. But straightway one of the commanders, Medisinissas,
fearing lest he should escape and again make trouble for them, cut off
his head and taking it to his home shewed it to his wives, for it was
a remarkable sight on account of the extraordinary size of the head
and the abundance of hair. And now, since the narration of the history
has brought me to this point, it is necessary to tell from the
beginning whence the nations of the Moors came to Libya and how they
settled there.
</p>
<p>When the Hebrews had withdrawn from Egypt and had come near the
boundaries of Palestine, Moses, a wise man, who was their leader on
the journey, died, and the leadership was passed on to Joshua, the son
of Nun, who led this people into Palestine, and, by displaying a
valour in war greater than that natural to a man, gained possession of
the land. And after overthrowing all the nations he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_x_14" id="PageIV_x_14">[14-24]</a></span>
easily won
the cities, and he seemed to be altogether invincible. Now at that
time the whole country along the sea from Sidon as far as the
boundaries of Egypt was called Phoenicia. And one king in ancient
times held sway over it, as is agreed by all who have written the
earliest accounts of the Phoenicians. In that country there dwelt very
populous tribes, the Gergesites and the Jebusites and some others with
other names by which they are called in the history of the
Hebrews.<a name="FNanchor_33_IV" id="FNanchor_33_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_33_IV" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Now when these nations saw that the invading general was
an irresistible prodigy, they emigrated from their ancestral homes and
made their way to Egypt, which adjoined their country. And finding
there no place sufficient for them to dwell in, since there has been a
great population in Aegypt from ancient times, they proceeded to
Libya. And they established numerous cities and took possession of the
whole of Libya as far as the Pillars of Heracles, and there they have
lived even up to my time, using the Phoenician tongue. They also built
a fortress in Numidia, where now is the city called Tigisis. In that
place are two columns made of white stone near by the great spring,
having Phoenician letters cut in them which say in the Phoenician
tongue: "We are they who fled from before the face of Joshua, the
robber, the son of Nun." There were also other nations settled in
Libya before the Moors, who on account of having been established
there from of old were said to be children of the soil. And because of
this they said that Antaeus, their king, who wrestled with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_x_24" id="PageIV_x_24">[24-2]</a></span>

Heracles in Clipea,<a name="FNanchor_34_IV" id="FNanchor_34_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_34_IV" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> was a son of the earth. And in later times
those who removed from Phoenicia with Dido came to the inhabitants of
Libya as to kinsmen. And they willingly allowed them to found and hold
Carthage. But as time went on Carthage became a powerful and populous
city. And a battle took place between them and their neighbours, who,
as has been said, had come from Palestine before them and are called
Moors at the present time, and the Carthaginians defeated them and
compelled them to live a very great distance away from Carthage. Later
on the Romans gained the supremacy over all of them in war, and
settled the Moors at the extremity of the inhabited land of Libya, and
made the Carthaginians and the other Libyans subject and tributary to
themselves. And after this the Moors won many victories over the
Vandals and gained possession of the land now called Mauretania,
extending from Gadira as far as the boundaries of Caesarea,<a name="FNanchor_35_IV" id="FNanchor_35_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_35_IV" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> as
well as the most of Libya which remained. Such, then, is the story of
the settlement of the Moors in Libya.
</p><br />
<p>XI</p>
<p>

Now when Solomon heard what had befallen Rufinus and Agan, he made
ready for war and wrote as follows to the commanders of the Moors:
"Other men than you have even before this had the ill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xi_2" id="PageIV_xi_2">[2-9]</a></span>
fortune to
lose their senses and to be destroyed, men who had no means of judging
beforehand how their folly would turn out. But as for you, who have
the example near at hand in your neighbours, the Vandals, what in the
world has happened to you that you have decided to raise your hands
against the great emperor and throw away your own security, and that
too when you have given the most dread oaths in writing and have
handed over your children as pledges to the agreement? Is it that you
have determined to make a kind of display of the fact that you have no
consideration either for God or for good faith or for kinship itself
or for safety or for any other thing at all? And yet, if such is your
practice in matters which concern the divine, in what ally do you put
your trust in marching against the emperor of the Romans? And if you
are taking the field to the destruction of your children, what in the
world is it in behalf of which you have decided to endanger
yourselves? But if any repentance has by now entered your hearts for
what has already taken place, write to us, that we may satisfactorily
arrange with you touching what has already been done; but if your
madness has not yet abated, expect a Roman war, which will come upon
you together with the oaths which you have violated and the wrong
which you are doing to your own children."
</p>
<p>Such was the letter which Solomon wrote. And the Moors replied as
follows: "Belisarius deluded us with great promises and by this means
persuaded us to become subjects of the Emperor Justinian; but the
Romans, while giving us no share in any good thing, expected to have
us, though pinched with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xi_9" id="PageIV_xi_9">[9-18]</a></span>
hunger, as their friends and allies.
Therefore it is more fitting that you should be called faithless than
that the Moors should be. For the men who break treaties are not those
who, when manifestly wronged, bring accusation against their
neighbours and turn away from them, but those who expect to keep
others in faithful alliance with them and then do them violence. And
men make God their enemy, not when they march against others in order
to recover their own possessions, but when they get themselves into
danger of war by encroaching upon the possessions of others. And as
for children, that will be your concern, who are not permitted to
marry more than one wife; but with us, who have, it may be, fifty
wives living with each of us, offspring of children can never fail."
</p>
<p>When Solomon had read this letter, he decided to lead his whole army
against the Moors. So after arranging matters in Carthage, he
proceeded with all his troops to Byzacium. And when he reached the
place which is called Mammes,<a name="FNanchor_36_IV" id="FNanchor_36_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_36_IV" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> where the four Moorish commanders,
whom I have mentioned a little before,<a name="FNanchor_37_IV" id="FNanchor_37_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_37_IV" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> were encamped, he made a
stockade for himself. Now there are lofty mountains there, and a level
space near the foothills of the mountains, where the barbarians had
made preparations for the battle and arranged their fighting order as
follows. They formed a circle of their camels, just as, in the
previous narrative,<a name="FNanchor_38_IV" id="FNanchor_38_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_38_IV" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
I have said Cabaon did, making the front about
twelve deep. And they placed the women with the children within the
circle; (for among the Moors it is customary to take also a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xi_18" id="PageIV_xi_18">[18-24]</a></span>
women, with their children, to battle, and these make the stockades
and huts for them and tend the horses skilfully, and have charge of
the camels and the food; they also sharpen the iron weapons and take
upon themselves many of the tasks in connection with the preparation
for battle); and the men themselves took their stand on foot in
between the legs of the camels, having shields and swords and small
spears which they are accustomed to hurl like javelins. And some of
them with their horses remained quietly among the mountains. But
Solomon disregarded one half of the circle of the Moors, which was
towards the mountain, placing no one there. For he feared lest the
enemy on the mountain should come down and those in the circle should
turn about and thus make the men drawn up there exposed to attack on
both sides in the battle. But against the remainder of the circle he
drew up his whole army, and since he saw the most of them frightened
and without courage, on account of what had befallen Agan and
Rufinus, and wishing to admonish them to be of good cheer, he spoke as
follows: "Men who have campaigned with Belisarius, let no fear of
these men enter your minds, and, if Moors gathered to the number of
fifty thousand have already defeated five hundred Romans, let not this
stand for you as an example. But call to mind your own valour, and
consider that while the Vandals defeated the Moors, you have become
masters of the Vandals in war without any effort, and that it is not
right that those who have conquered the greater should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xi_24" id="PageIV_xi_24">[24-35]</a></span>
terrified before those who are inferior. And indeed of all men the
Moorish nation seems to be the most poorly equipped for war's
struggle. For the most of them have no armour at all, and those who
have shields to hold before themselves have only small ones which are
not well made and are not able to turn aside what strikes against
them. And after they have thrown those two small spears, if they do
not accomplish anything, they turn of their own accord to flight. So
that it is possible for you, after guarding against the first attack
of the barbarians, to win the victory with no trouble at all. But as
to your equipment of arms, you see, of course, how great is the
difference between it and that of your opponents. And apart from this,
both valour of heart and strength of body and experience in war and
confidence because you have already conquered all your enemies,&mdash;all
these advantages you have; but the Moors, being deprived of all these
things, put their trust only in their own great throng. And it is
easier for a few who are most excellently prepared to conquer a
multitude of men not good at warfare than it is for the multitude to
defeat them. For while the good soldier has his confidence in himself,
the cowardly man generally finds that the very number of those arrayed
with him produces a want of room that is full of peril. Furthermore,
you are warranted in despising these camels, which cannot fight for
the enemy, and when struck by our missiles will, in all probability,
become the cause of considerable confusion and disorder among them.
And the eagerness for battle which the enemy have acquired on account
of their former success will be your ally in the fight. For daring,
when it is kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xi_35" id="PageIV_xi_35">[35-42]</a></span>
 commensurate with one's power, will perhaps be
of some benefit even to those who make use of it, but when it exceeds
one's power it lends into danger. Bearing these things in mind and
despising the enemy, observe silence and order; for by taking thought
for these things we shall win the victory over the disorder of the
barbarians more easily and with less labour." Thus spoke Solomon.
</p>
<p>And the commanders of the Moors also, seeing the barbarians terrified
at the orderly array of the Romans, and wishing to recall their host
to confidence again, exhorted them in this wise: "That the Romans have
human bodies, the kind that yield when struck with iron, we have been
taught, O fellow-soldiers, by those of them whom we have recently met,
the best of them all, some of whom we have overwhelmed with our spears
and killed, and the others we have seized and made our prisoners of
war. And not only is this so, but it is now possible to see also that
we boast great superiority over them in numbers. And, furthermore, the
struggle for us involves the very greatest things, either to be
masters of all Libya or to be slaves to these braggarts. It is
therefore necessary for us to be in the highest degree brave men at
the present time. For it is not expedient that those whose all is at
stake should be other than exceedingly courageous. And it behoves us
to despise the equipment of arms which the enemy have. For if they
come on foot against us, they will not be able to move rapidly, but
will be worsted by the agility of the Moors, and their cavalry will be
terrified both by the sight of the camels, and by the noise they make,
which, rising above the general tumult of battle, will,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xi_42" id="PageIV_xi_42">[42-51]</a></span>
 in all
likelihood, throw them into disorder. And if anyone by taking into
consideration the victory of the Romans over the Vandals thinks them
not to be withstood, he is mistaken in his judgment. For the scales of
war are, in the nature of the case, turned by the valour of the
commander or by fortune; and Belisarius, who was responsible for their
gaining the mastery over the Vandals, has now, thanks to Heaven, been
removed out of our way. And, besides, we too have many times conquered
the Vandals and stripped them of their power, and have thus made the
victory over them a more feasible and an easier task for the Romans.
And now we have reason to hope to conquer this enemy also if you shew
yourselves brave men in the struggle."
</p>
<p>After the officers of the Moors had delivered this exhortation, they
began the engagement. And at first there arose great disorder in the
Roman army. For their horses were offended by the noise made by the
camels and by the sight of them, and reared up and threw off their
riders and the most of them fled in complete disorder. And in the
meantime the Moors were making sallies and hurling all the small
spears which they had in their hands, thus causing the Roman army to
be filled with tumult, and they were hitting them with their missiles
while they were unable either to defend themselves or to remain in
position. But after this, Solomon, observing what was happening,
leaped down from his horse himself first and caused all the others to
do the same. And when they had dismounted, he commanded the others to
stand still, and, holding their shields before them and receiving the
missiles sent by the enemy, to remain in their position; but he
himself, leading forward not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xi_51" id="PageIV_xi_51">[51-2]</a></span>
 less than five hundred men, made
an attack upon the other portion of the circle.<a name="FNanchor_39_IV" id="FNanchor_39_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_39_IV" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> These men he
commanded to draw their swords and kill the camels which stood at that
point. Then the Moors who were stationed there beat a hasty retreat,
and the men under Solomon killed about two hundred camels, and
straightway, when the camels fell, the circle became accessible to the
Romans. And they advanced on the run into the middle of the circle
where the women of the Moors were sitting; meanwhile the barbarians in
consternation withdrew to the mountain which was close by, and as they
fled in complete disorder the Romans followed behind and killed them.
And it is said that ten thousand of the Moors perished in this
encounter, while all the women together with the children were made
slaves. And the soldiers secured as booty all the camels which they
had not killed. Thus the Romans with all their plunder went to
Carthage to celebrate the festival of triumph.
</p><br />
<p>XII</p>
<p>

But the barbarians, being moved with anger, once more took the field
in a body against the Romans, leaving behind not one of their number,
and they began to overrun the country in Byzacium, sparing none of any
age of those who fell in their way. And when Solomon had just marched
into Carthage it was reported that the barbarians with a great host
had come into Byzacium and were plundering everything there. He
therefore departed quickly with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xii_2" id="PageIV_xii_2">[2-10]</a></span>
 whole army and marched
against them. And when he reached Bourgaon, where the enemy were
encamped, he remained some days in camp over against them, in order
that, as soon as the Moors should get on level ground, he might begin
the battle. But since they remained on the mountain, he marshalled his
army and arrayed it for battle; the Moors, however, had no intention
of ever again engaging in battle with the Romans in level country (for
already an irresistible fear had come over them), but on the mountain
they hoped to overcome them more easily. Now Mt. Bourgaon is for the
most part precipitous and on the side toward the east extremely
difficult to ascend, but on the west it is easily accessible and rises
in an even slope. And there are two lofty peaks which rise up, forming
between them a sort of vale, very narrow, but of incredible depth. Now
the barbarians left the peak of the mountain unoccupied, thinking that
on this side no hostile movement would be made against them; and they
left equally unprotected the space about the foot of the mountain
where Bourgaon was easy of access. But at the middle of the ascent
they made their camp and remained there, in order that, if the enemy
should ascend and begin battle with them, they might at the outset,
being on higher ground, shoot down upon their heads. They also had on
the mountain many horses, prepared either for flight or for the
pursuit, if they should win the battle.
</p>
<p>Now when Solomon saw that the Moors were unwilling to fight another
battle on the level ground, and also that the Roman army was opposed
to making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xii_10" id="PageIV_xii_10">[10-17]</a></span>
 a siege in a desert place, he was eager to come to an
encounter with the enemy on Bourgaon. But inasmuch as he saw that the
soldiers were stricken with terror because of the multitude of their
opponents, which was many times greater than it had been in the
previous battle, he called together the army and spoke as follows:
"The fear which the enemy feel toward you needs no other arraignment,
but voluntarily pleads guilty, bringing forward, as it does, the
testimony of its own witnesses. For you see, surely, our opponents
gathered in so many tens and tens of thousands, but not daring to come
down to the plain and engage with us, unable to feel confidence even
in their own selves, but taking refuge in the difficulty of this
place. It is therefore not even necessary to address any exhortation
to you, at the present time at least. For those to whom both the
circumstances and the weakness of the enemy give courage, need not, I
think, the additional assistance of words. But of this one thing it
will be needful to remind you, that if we fight out this engagement
also with brave hearts, it will remain for us, having defeated the
Vandals and reduced the Moors to the same fortune, to enjoy all the
good things of Libya, having no thought whatever of an enemy in our
minds. But as to preventing the enemy from shooting down upon our
heads, and providing that no harm come to us from the nature of the
place, I myself shall make provision."
</p>
<p>After making this exhortation Solomon commanded Theodorus, who led the
"excubitores<a name="FNanchor_40_IV" id="FNanchor_40_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_40_IV" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>"
(for thus the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xii_17" id="PageIV_xii_17">[17-21]</a></span>
Romans call their guards), to
take with him a thousand infantrymen toward the end of the afternoon
and with some of the standards to go up secretly on the east side of
Bourgaon, where the mountain is most difficult of ascent and, one
might say, impracticable, commanding him that, when they arrived near
the crest of the mountain, they should remain quietly there and pass
the rest of the night, and that at sunrise they should appear above
the enemy and displaying the standards commence to shoot. And
Theodoras did as directed. And when it was well on in the night, they
climbed up the precipitous slope and reached a point near the peak
without being noticed either by the Moors or even by any of the
Romans; for they were being sent out, it was said, as an advance
guard, to prevent anyone from coming to the camp from the outside to
do mischief. And at early dawn Solomon with the whole army went up
against the enemy to the outskirts of Bourgaon. And when morning had
come and the enemy were seen near at hand, the soldiers were
completely at a loss, seeing the summit of the mountain no longer
unoccupied, as formerly, but covered with men who were displaying
Roman standards; for already some daylight was beginning to shew. But
when those on the peak began their attack, the Romans perceived that
the army was their own and the barbarians that they had been placed
between their enemy's forces, and being shot at from both sides and
having no opportunity to ward off the enemy, they thought no more of
resistance but turned, all of them, to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xii_21" id="PageIV_xii_21">[21-28]</a></span>
 hasty flight. And since
they could neither run up to the top of Bourgaon, which was held by
the enemy, nor go to the plain anywhere over the lower slopes of the
mountain, since their opponents were pressing upon them from that
side, they went with a great rush to the vale and the unoccupied peak,
some even with their horses, others on foot. But since they were a
numerous throng fleeing in great fear and confusion, they kept killing
each other, and as they rushed into the vale, which was exceedingly
deep, those who were first were being killed constantly, but their
plight could not be perceived by those who were coming up behind. And
when the vale became full of dead horses and men, and the bodies made
a passage from Bourgaon to the other mountain, then the remainder were
saved by making the crossing over the bodies. And there perished in
this struggle, among the Moors fifty thousand, as was declared by
those of them who survived, but among the Romans no one at all, nor
indeed did anyone receive even a wound, either at the hand of the
enemy or by any accident happening to him, but they all enjoyed this
victory unscathed. All of the leaders of the barbarians also made
their escape, except Esdilasas, who received pledges and surrendered
himself to the Romans. So great, however, was the multitude of women
and children whom the Romans seized as booty, that they would sell a
Moorish boy for the price of a sheep to any who wished to buy. And
then the remainder of the Moors recalled the saying of their women, to
the effect that their nation would be destroyed by a beardless
man.<a name="FNanchor_41_IV" id="FNanchor_41_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_41_IV" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xii_29" id="PageIV_xii_29">[29-4]</a></span>
So the Roman army, together with its booty and with Esdilasas,
marched into Carthage; and those of the barbarians who had not
perished decided that it was impossible to settle in Byzacium, lest
they, being few, should be treated with violence by the Libyans who
were their neighbours, and with their leaders they went into Numidia
and made themselves suppliants of Iaudas, who ruled the Moors in
Aurasium.<a name="FNanchor_42_IV" id="FNanchor_42_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_42_IV" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
And the only Moors who remained in Byzacium were those
led by Antalas, who during this time had kept faith with the Romans
and together with his subjects had remained unharmed.
</p><br />
<p>XIII</p>
<p>

But during the time when these things were happening in Byzacium,
Iaudas, who ruled the Moors in Aurasium, bringing more than thirty
thousand fighting men, was plundering the country of Numidia and
enslaving many of the Libyans. Now it so happened
that Althias<a name="FNanchor_43_IV" id="FNanchor_43_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_43_IV" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
in
Centuriae was keeping guard over the forts there; and he, being eager
to take from the enemy some of their captives, went outside the fort
with the Huns who were under his command, to the number of about
seventy. And reasoning that he was not able to cope with such a great
multitude of Moors with only seventy men, he wished to occupy some
narrow pass, so that, while the enemy were marching through it, he
might be able to snatch up some of the captives. And since there are
no such roads there, because flat plains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiii_4" id="PageIV_xiii_4">[4-14]</a></span>
 extend in every
direction, he devised the following plan.
</p>
<p>There is a city not far distant, named Tigisis, then an unwalled
place, but having a great spring at a place which was very closely
shut in. Althias therefore decided to take possession of this spring,
reasoning that the enemy, compelled by thirst, would surely come
there; for there is no other water at all close by. Now it seemed to
all upon considering the disparity of the armies that his plan was
insane. But the Moors came up feeling very much wearied and greatly
oppressed by the heat in the summer weather, and naturally almost
overcome by an intense thirst, and they made for the spring with a
great rush, having no thought of meeting any obstacle. But when they
found the water held by the enemy, they all halted, at a loss what to
do, the greatest part of their strength having been already expended
because of their desire for water. Iaudas therefore had a parley with
Althias and agreed to give him the third part of the booty, on
condition that the Moors should all drink. But Althias was by no means
willing to accept the proposal, but demanded that he fight with him in
single combat for the booty. And this challenge being accepted by
Iaudas, it was agreed that if it so fell out that Althias was
overcame, the Moors should drink. And the whole Moorish army was
rejoiced, being in good hope, since Althias was lean and not tall of
body, while Iaudas was the finest and most warlike of all the Moors.
Now both of them were, as it happened, mounted. And Iaudas hurled his
spear first, but as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiii_14" id="PageIV_xiii_14">[14-21]</a></span>
 it was coming toward him Althias succeeded
with amazing skill in catching it with his right hand, thus filling
Iaudas and the enemy with consternation. And with his left hand he
drew his bow instantly, for he was ambidextrous, and hit and killed
the horse of Iaudas. And as he fell, the Moors brought another horse
for their commander, upon which Iaudas leaped and straightway fled;
and the Moorish army followed him in complete disorder. And Althias,
by thus taking from them the captives and the whole of the booty, won
a great name in consequence of this deed throughout all Libya. Such,
then, was the course of these events.
</p>
<p>And Solomon, after delaying a short time in Carthage, led his army
toward Mt. Aurasium and Iaudas, alleging against him that, while the
Roman army was occupied in Byzacium, he had plundered many of the
places in Numidia. And this was true. Solomon was also urged on
against Iaudas by the other commanders of the Moors, Massonas and
Ortaas, because of their personal enmity; Massonas, because his
father Mephanias, who was the father-in-law of Iaudas, had been
treacherously slain by him, and Ortaas, because Iaudas, together with
Mastinas, who ruled over the barbarians in Mauretania, had purposed to
drive him and all the Moors whom he ruled from the land where they had
dwelt from of old. So the Roman army, under the leadership of Solomon,
and those of the Moors who came into alliance with them, made their
camp on the river Abigas, which flows along by Aurasium and waters the
land there. But to Iaudas it seemed inexpedient to array himself
against the enemy in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiii_21" id="PageIV_xiii_21">[21-29]</a></span>
 plain, but he made his preparations on
Aurasium in such a way as seemed to him would offer most difficulty to
his assailants. This mountain is about thirteen days' journey distant
from Carthage, and the largest of all known to us. For its circuit is
a three days' journey for an unencumbered traveller. And for one
wishing to go upon it the mountain is difficult of access and
extremely wild, but as one ascends and reaches the level ground,
plains are seen and many springs which form rivers and a great number
of altogether wonderful parks. And the grain which grows here, and
every kind of fruit, is double the size of that produced in all the
rest of Libya. And there are fortresses also on this mountain, which
are neglected, by reason of the fact that they do not seem necessary
to the inhabitants. For since the time when the Moors wrested Aurasium
from the Vandals,<a name="FNanchor_44_IV" id="FNanchor_44_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_44_IV" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
not a single enemy had until now ever come there
or so much as caused the barbarians to be afraid that they would come,
but even the populous city of Tamougadis, situated against the
mountain on the east at the beginning of the plain, was emptied of its
population by the Moors and razed to the ground, in order that the
enemy should not only not be able to encamp there, but should not even
have the city as an excuse for coming near the mountain. And the Moors
of that place held also the land to the west of Aurasium, a tract both
extensive and fertile. And beyond these dwelt other nations of the
Moors, who were ruled by Ortaas, who had come, as was stated above,
as an ally to Solomon and the Romans. And I have heard this man say
that beyond the country which he ruled there was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiii_29" id="PageIV_xiii_29">[29-36]</a></span>
 habitation
of men, but desert land extending to a great distance, and that beyond
that there are men, not black-skinned like the Moors, but very white
in body and fair-haired. So much, then, for these things.</p> <p>And Solomon,
after bribing the Moorish allies with great sums of money and
earnestly exhorting them, began the ascent of Mt. Aurasium with the
whole army arrayed as for battle, thinking that on that day he would
do battle with the enemy and just as he was have the matter out with
them according as fortune should wish. Accordingly the soldiers did
not even take with them any food, except a little, for themselves and
their horses. And after proceeding over very rough ground for about
fifty stades, they made a bivouac. And covering a similar distance
each day they came on the seventh day to a place where there was an
ancient fortress and an ever-flowing stream. The place is called
"Shield Mountain" by the Romans in their
own tongue.<a name="FNanchor_45_IV" id="FNanchor_45_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_45_IV" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Now it was
reported to them that the enemy were encamped there, and when they
reached this place and encountered no enemy, they made camp and,
preparing themselves for battle, remained there; and three days' time
was spent by them in that place. And since the enemy kept altogether
out of their way, and their provisions had failed, the thought came to
Solomon and to the whole army that there had been some plot against
them on the part of the Moors who were their allies; for these Moors
were not unacquainted with the conditions of travel on Aurasium, and
understood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiii_36" id="PageIV_xiii_36">[36-42]</a></span>
 probably, what had been decided upon by the enemy; they were
stealthily going out to meet them each day, it was said, and had also
frequently been sent to their country by the Romans to reconnoitre,
and had decided to make nothing but false reports, in order, no doubt,
that the Romans, with no prior knowledge of conditions, might make the
ascent of Mt. Aurasium without supplies for a longer time or without
preparing themselves otherwise in the way which would be best. And,
all things considered, the Romans were suspicious that an ambush had
been set for them by men who were their allies and began to be afraid,
reasoning that the Moors are said to be by nature untrustworthy at all
times and especially whenever they march as allies with the Romans or
any others against Moors. So, remembering these things, and at the
same time being pinched by hunger, they withdrew from there with all
speed without accomplishing anything, and, upon reaching the plain,
constructed a stockade.
</p>
<p>After this Solomon established a part of the army in Numidia to serve
as a guard and with the remainder went to Carthage, since it was
already winter. There he arranged and set everything in order, so that
at the beginning of spring he might again march against Aurasium with
a larger equipment and, if possible, without Moors as allies. At the
same time he prepared generals and another army and a fleet of ships
for an expedition against the Moors who dwell in the island of
Sardinia; for this island is a large one and flourishing besides,
being about two thirds as large as Sicily (for the perimeter of the
island makes a journey of twenty days for an unencumbered traveller);
and lying, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiii_42" id="PageIV_xiii_42">[42-4]</a></span>
 it does, between Rome and Carthage, it was
oppressed by the Moors who dwelt there. For the Vandals in ancient
times, being enraged against these barbarians, sent some few of them
with their wives to Sardinia and confined them there. But as time went
on they seized the mountains which are near Caranalis, at first making
plundering expeditions secretly upon those who dwelt round about, but
when they became no less than three thousand, they even made their
raids openly, and with no desire for concealment plundered all the
country there, being called
Barbaricini<a name="FNanchor_46_IV" id="FNanchor_46_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_46_IV" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
by the natives. It was
against these barbarians, therefore, that Solomon was preparing the
fleet during that winter. Such, then, was the course of events in
Libya.
</p><br />
<p>XIV</p>
<p>

And in Italy during these same times the following events took place.
Belisarius was sent against Theodatus and the Gothic nation by the
Emperor Justinian, and sailing to Sicily he secured this island with
no trouble. And the manner in which this was done will be told in the
following pages, when the history leads me to the narration of the
events in Italy. For it has not seemed to me out of order first to
record all the events which happened in Libya and after that to turn
to the portion of the history touching Italy and the Goths.</p>


<p>During this winter Belisarius remained in Syracuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiv_4" id="PageIV_xiv_4">[4-10]</a></span>
 and Solomon in
Carthage. And it came about during this year that a most dread portent
took place. For the sun gave forth its light without brightness, like
the moon, during this whole year, and it seemed exceedingly like the
sun in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear nor such as it is
accustomed to shed. And from the time when this thing happened men
were free neither from war nor pestilence nor any other thing leading
to death. And it was the time when Justinian was in the tenth year of
his reign.<span class="sidenote">536-537 A.D.</span></p>
<p>
<span class="sidenote">536 A.D.</span>
At the opening of spring, when the Christians were celebrating the
feast which they call Easter, there arose a mutiny among the soldiers
in Libya. I shall now tell how it arose and to what end it came.
</p>
<p>After the Vandals had been defeated in the battle, as I have told
previously,<a name="FNanchor_47_IV" id="FNanchor_47_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_47_IV" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
the Roman soldiers took their daughters and wives and
made them their own by lawful marriage. And each one of these women
kept urging her husband to lay claim to the possession of the lands
which she had owned previously, saying that it was not right or
fitting if, while living with the Vandals, they had enjoyed these
lands, but after entering into marriage with the conquerors of the
Vandals they were then to be deprived of their possessions. And having
these things in mind, the soldiers did not think that they were bound
to yield the lands of the Vandals to Solomon, who wished to register
them as belonging to the commonwealth and to the emperor's house and
said that while it was not unreasonable that the slaves and all other
things of value should go as booty to the soldiers, the land itself
belonged to the emperor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiv_10" id="PageIV_xiv_10">[10-17]</a></span>
 the empire of the Romans, which had
nourished them and caused them to be called soldiers and to be such,
not in order to win for themselves such land as they should wrest from
the barbarians who were trespassing on the Roman empire, but that this
land might come to the commonwealth, from which both they and all
others secured their maintenance. This was one cause of the mutiny.
And there was a second, concurrent, cause also, which was no less,
perhaps even more, effective in throwing all Libya into confusion. It
was as follows: In the Roman army there were, as it happened, not less
than one. thousand soldiers of the Arian faith; and the most of these
were barbarians, some of these being of
the Erulian<a name="FNanchor_48_IV" id="FNanchor_48_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_48_IV" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
nation. Now
these men were urged on to the mutiny by the priests of the Vandals
with the greatest zeal. For it was not possible for them to worship
God in their accustomed way, but they were excluded both from all
sacraments and from all sacred rites. For the Emperor Justinian did
not allow any Christian who did not espouse the orthodox faith to
receive baptism or any other sacrament. But most of all they were
agitated by the feast of Easter, during which they found themselves
unable
to baptize<a name="FNanchor_49_IV" id="FNanchor_49_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_49_IV" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
their own children with the sacred water, or do
anything else pertaining to this feast. And as if these things were
not sufficient for Heaven, in its eagerness to ruin the fortunes of
the Romans, it so fell out that still another thing provided an
occasion for those who were planning the mutiny. For the Vandals whom
Belisarius took to Byzantium were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiv_17" id="PageIV_xiv_17">[17-23]</a></span>
 placed by the emperor in five
cavalry squadrons, in order that they might be settled permanently in
the cities of the East; he also called them the "Vandals of
Justinian," and ordered them to betake themselves in ships to the
East. Now the majority of these Vandal soldiers reached the East, and,
filling up the squadrons to which they had been assigned, they have
been fighting against the Persians up to the present time; but the
remainder, about four hundred in number, after reaching Lesbos,
waiting until the sails were bellied with the wind, forced the sailors
to submission and sailed on till they reached the Peloponnesus. And
setting sail from there, they came to land in Libya at a desert place,
where they abandoned the ships, and, after equipping themselves, went
up to Mt. Aurasium and Mauretania. Elated by their accession, the
soldiers who were planning the mutiny formed a still closer conspiracy
among themselves. And there was much talk about this in the camp and
oaths were already being taken. And when the rest were about to
celebrate the Easter festival, the Arians, being vexed by their
exclusion from the sacred rites, purposed to attack them vigorously.
</p>
<p>And it seemed best to their leading men to kill Solomon in the
sanctuary on the first day of the feast, which they call the great
day.
<span class="sidenote">March 23, 536 A.D.</span>
And they were fortunate enough not to be found out, since no one
disclosed this plan. For though there were many who shared in the
horrible plot, no word of it was divulged to any hostile person as the
orders were passed around, and thus they succeeded completely in
escaping detection, for even the spearmen and guards of Solomon for
the most part and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiv_23" id="PageIV_xiv_23">[23-29]</a></span>
 majority of his domestics had become associated
with this mutiny because of their desire for the lands. And when the
appointed day had now come, Solomon was sitting in the sanctuary,
utterly ignorant of his own misfortune. And those who had decided to
kill the man went in, and, urging one another with nods, they put
their hands to their swords, but they did nothing nevertheless, either
because they were filled with awe of the rites then being performed in
the sanctuary, or because the fame of the general caused them to be
ashamed, or perhaps also some divine power prevented them.
</p>
<p>And when the rites on that day had been completely performed and all
were betaking themselves homeward, the conspirators began to blame one
another with having turned soft-hearted at no fitting time, and they
postponed the plot for a second attempt on the following day. And on
the next day they acted in the same manner and departed from the
sanctuary without doing anything, and entering the market place, they
reviled each other openly, and every single man of them called the
next one soft-hearted and a demoralizer of the band, not hesitating to
censure strongly the respect felt for Solomon. For this reason,
indeed, they thought that they could no longer without danger remain
in Carthage, inasmuch as they had disclosed their plot to the whole
city. The most of them, accordingly, went out of the city quickly and
began to plunder the lands and to treat as enemies all the Libyans
whom they met; but the rest remained in the city, giving no indication
of what their own intentions were but pretending ignorance of the plot
which had been formed.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiv_30" id="PageIV_xiv_30">[30-37]</a></span></p>
<p>
But Solomon, upon hearing what was being done by the soldiers
in the country, became greatly disturbed, and ceased not exhorting
those in the city and urging them to loyalty toward the emperor. And
they at first seemed to receive his words with favour, but on the
fifth day, when they heard that those who had gone out were secure in
their power, they gathered in the hippodrome and insulted Solomon and
the other commanders without restraint. And Theodorus, the
Cappadocian, being sent there by Solomon, attempted to dissuade them
and win them by kind words, but they listened to nothing of what was
said. Now this Theodorus had a certain hostility against Solomon and
was suspected of plotting against him. For this reason the mutineers
straightway elected him general over them by acclamation, and with him
they went with all speed to the palace carrying weapons and raising a
great tumult. There they killed another Theodorus, who was commander
of the guards, a man of the greatest excellence in every respect and
an especially capable warrior. And when they had tasted this blood,
they began immediately to kill everyone they met, whether Libyan or
Roman, if he were known to Solomon or had money in his hands; and then
they turned to plundering, going up into the houses which had no
soldiers to defend them and seizing all the most valuable things,
until the coming of night, and drunkenness following their toil, made
them cease.</p> <p>And Solomon succeeded in escaping unnoticed into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xiv_37" id="PageIV_xiv_37">[37-1]</a></span>
great sanctuary which is in the palace, and Martinus joined him there
in the late afternoon. And when all the mutineers were sleeping, they
went out from the sanctuary and entered the house of Theodorus, the
Cappadocian, who compelled them to dine although they had no desire to
do so, and conveyed them to the harbour and put them on the skiff of a
certain ship, which happened to have been made ready there by
Martinus. And Procopius also, who wrote this history, was with them,
and about five men of the house of Solomon. And after accomplishing
three hundred stades they reached Misuas, the ship-yard of Carthage,
and, since they had reached safety, Solomon straightway commanded
Martinus to go into Numidia to Valerian and the others who shared his
command, and endeavour to bring it about that each one of them, if it
were in any way possible, should appeal to some of the soldiers known
to him, either with money or by other means, and bring them back to
loyalty toward the emperor. And he sent a letter to Theodorus,
charging him to take care of Carthage and to handle the other matters
as should seem possible to him, and he himself with Procopius went to
Belisarius at Syracuse. And after reporting everything to him which
had taken place in Libya, he begged him to come with all speed to
Carthage and defend the emperor, who was suffering unholy treatment at
the hands of his own soldiers, Solomon, then, was thus engaged.
</p><br />
<p>XV</p>
<p>

But the mutineers, after plundering everything in Carthage, gathered
in the plain of Boulla, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xv_1" id="PageIV_xv_1">[1-8]</a></span>
 chose Stotzas,<a name="FNanchor_50_IV" id="FNanchor_50_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_50_IV" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
one of the guards
of Martinus, and a passionate and energetic man, as tyrant over them,
with the purpose of driving the emperor's commanders out of all Libya
and thus gaining control over it. And he armed the whole force,
amounting to about eight thousand men, and led them on to Carthage,
thinking to win over the city instantly with no trouble. He sent also
to the Vandals who had run away from Byzantium with the ships and
those who had not gone there with Belisarius in the beginning, either
because they had escaped notice, or because those who were taking off
the Vandals at that time took no account of them. Now they were not
fewer than a thousand, and after no great time they joined Stotzas and
the army with enthusiasm. And a great throng of slaves also came to
him. And when they drew near Carthage, Stotzas sent orders that the
people should surrender the city to him as quickly as possible, on
condition of their remaining free from harm. But those in Carthage and
Theodorus, in reply to this, refused flatly to obey, and announced
that they were guarding Carthage for the emperor. And they sent to
Stotzas Joseph, the secretary of the emperor's guards, a man of no
humble birth and one of the household of Belisarius, who had recently
been sent to Carthage on some mission to them, and they demanded that
Stotzas should go no further in his violence. But Stotzas, upon
hearing this, straightway killed Joseph and commenced a siege. And
those in the city, becoming terrified at the danger, were purposing to
surrender themselves and Carthage to Stotzas under an agreement. Such
was the course of events in the army in Libya.</p> <p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xv_9" id="PageIV_xv_9">[9-16]</a></span>
But Belisarius
selected one hundred men from his own spearmen and guards, and taking
Solomon with him, sailed into Carthage with one ship at about dusk, at
the time when the besiegers were expecting that the city would be
surrendered to them on the following day. And since they were
expecting this, they bivouacked that night. But when day had come and
they learned that Belisarius was present, they broke up camp as
quickly as possible and disgracefully and in complete disorder beat a
hasty retreat And Belisarius gathered about two thousand of the army
and, after urging them with words to be loyal to the emperor and
encouraging them with large gifts of money, he began the pursuit of
the fugitives. And he overtook them at the city of Membresa, three
hundred and fifty stades distant from Carthage. There both armies made
camp and prepared themselves for battle, the forces of Belisarius
making their entrenchment at the River Bagradas, and the others in a
high and difficult position. For neither of them saw fit to enter the
city, since it was without walls. And on the day following they joined
battle, the mutineers trusting in their numbers, and the troops of
Belisarius despising their enemy as both without sense and without
generals. And Belisarius, wishing that these thoughts should be firmly
lodged in the minds of his soldiers, called them all together and
spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>
"The situation, fellow-soldiers, both for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xv_16" id="PageIV_xv_16">[16-23]</a></span>
 emperor and for the Romans, falls far short of our hopes and of
our prayers. For we have now come to a combat in which even the
winning of the victory will not be without tears for us, since we are
fighting against kinsmen and men who have been reared with us. But we
have this comfort in our misfortune, that we are not ourselves
beginning the battle, but have been brought into the conflict in our
own defence. For he who has framed the plot against his dearest
friends and by his own act has dissolved the ties of kinship, dies
not, if he perishes, by the hands of his friends, but having become an
enemy is but making atonement to those who have suffered wrong. And
that our opponents are public enemies and barbarians and whatever
worse name one might call them, is shewn not alone by Libya, which has
become plunder under their hands, nor by the inhabitants of this land,
who have been wrongfully slain, but also by the multitude of Roman
soldiers whom these enemies have dared to kill, though they have had
but one fault to charge them with&mdash;loyalty to their government. And it
is to avenge these their victims that we have now come against them,
having with good reason become enemies to those who were once most
dear. For nature has made no men in the world either friends or
opponents to one another, but it is the actions of men in every case
which, either by the similarity of the motives which actuate them
unite them in alliance, or by the difference set them in hostility to
each other, making them friends or enemies as the case may be. That,
therefore, we are fighting against men who are outlaws and enemies of
the state, you must now be convinced; and now I shall make it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xv_23" id="PageIV_xv_23">[23-33]</a></span>
plain that they deserve to be despised by us. For a throng of men
united by no law, but brought together by motives of injustice, is
utterly unable by nature to play the part of brave men, since valour
is unable to dwell with lawlessness, but always shuns those who are
unholy. Nor, indeed, will they preserve discipline or give heed to the
commands given by Stotzas. For when a tyranny is newly organized and
has not yet won that authority which self-confidence gives, it is, of
necessity, looked upon by its subjects with contempt. Nor is it
honoured through any sentiment of loyalty, for a tyranny is, in the
nature of the case, hated; nor does it lead its subjects by fear, for
timidity deprives it of the power to speak out openly. And when the
enemy is handicapped in point of valour and of discipline, their
defeat is ready at hand. With great contempt, therefore, as I said, we
should go against this enemy of ours. For it is not by the numbers of
the combatants, but by their orderly array and their bravery, that
prowess in war is wont to be measured."
</p>
<p>So spoke Belisarius. And Stotzas exhorted his troops as follows: "Men
who with me have escaped our servitude to the Romans, let no one of
you count it unworthy to die on behalf of the freedom which you have
won by your courage and your other qualities. For it is not so
terrible a thing to grow old and die in the midst of ills, as to
return again to it after having gained freedom from oppressive
conditions. For the interval which has given one a taste of
deliverance makes the misfortune, naturally enough, harder to bear.
And this being so, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xv_33" id="PageIV_xv_33">[33-41]</a></span>
 necessary for you to call to mind that
after conquering the Vandals and the Moors you yourselves have enjoyed
the labours of war, while others have become masters of all the
spoils. And consider that, as soldiers, you will be compelled all your
lives to be acquainted with the dangers of war, either in behalf of
the emperor's cause, if, indeed, you are again his slaves, or in
behalf of your own selves, if you preserve this present liberty. And
whichever of the two is preferable, this it is in your power to
choose, either by becoming faint-hearted at this time, or by
preferring to play the part of brave men. Furthermore, this thought
also should come to your minds,&mdash;that if, having taken up arms against
the Romans, you come under their power, you will have experience of no
moderate or indulgent masters, but you will suffer the extreme of
punishment, and, what is more, your death will not have been
unmerited. To whomsoever of you, therefore, death comes in this
battle, it is plain that it will be a glorious death; and life, if you
conquer the enemy, will be independent and in all other respects
happy; but if you are defeated,&mdash;I need mention no other bitterness
than this, that all your hope will depend upon the mercy of those men
yonder. And the conflict will not be evenly matched in regard to
strength. For not only are the enemy greatly surpassed by us in
numbers, but they will come against us without the least enthusiasm,
for I think that they are praying for a share of this our freedom."
Such was the speech of Stotzas.
</p>
<p>As the armies entered the combat, a wind both violent and exceedingly
troublesome began to blow in the faces of the mutineers of Stotzas.
For this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xv_41" id="PageIV_xv_41">[41-49]</a></span>
 reason they thought it disadvantageous for them to
fight the battle where they were, fearing lest the wind by its
overpowering force should carry the missiles of the enemy against
them, while the impetus of their own missiles would be very seriously
checked. They therefore left their position and moved toward the
flank, reasoning that if the enemy also should change front, as they
probably would, in order that they might not be assailed from the
rear, the wind would then be in their faces. But Belisarius, upon
seeing that they had left their position and in complete disorder were
moving to his flank, gave orders immediately to open the attack. And
the troops of Stotzas were thrown into confusion by the unexpected
move, and in great disorder, as each one could, they fled
precipitately, and only when they reached Numidia did they collect
themselves again. Few of them, however, perished in this action, and
most of them were Vandals. For Belisarius did not pursue them at all,
for the reason that it seemed to him sufficient, since his army was
very small, if the enemy, having been defeated for the present, should
get out of his way. And he gave the soldiers the enemy's stockade to
plunder, and they took it with not a man inside. But much money was
found there and many women, the very women because of whom this war
took place.<a name="FNanchor_51_IV" id="FNanchor_51_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_51_IV" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
After accomplishing this, Belisarius marched back to
Carthage. And someone coming from Sicily reported to him that a mutiny
had broken out in the army and was about to throw everything into
confusion, unless he himself should return to them with all speed and
take measures to prevent it. He there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xv_49" id="PageIV_xv_49">[49-56]</a></span>
therefore arranged matters
in Libya as well as he could and, entrusting Carthage to Ildiger and
Theodorus, went to Sicily.
</p>
<p>And the Roman commanders in Numidia, hearing that the troops of
Stotzas had come and were gathering there, prepared for battle. Now
the commanders were as follows:
of foederati,<a name="FNanchor_52_IV" id="FNanchor_52_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_52_IV" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Marcellus and Cyril,
of the cavalry forces, Barbatus, and of infantry Terentius and
Sarapis. All, however, took their commands from Marcellus, as holding
the authority in Numidia. He, therefore, upon hearing that Stotzas
with some few men was in a place
called Gazophyla,<a name="FNanchor_53_IV" id="FNanchor_53_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_53_IV" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
about two days'
journey distant
from Constantina,<a name="FNanchor_54_IV" id="FNanchor_54_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_54_IV" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
wished to anticipate the
gathering of all the mutineers, and led his army swiftly against them.
And when the two armies were near together and the battle was about to
commence, Stotzas came alone into the midst of his opponents and spoke
as follows:</p>
<p>
"Fellow-soldiers, you are not acting justly in taking the field
against kinsmen and those who have been reared with you, and in
raising arms against men who in vexation at your misfortunes and the
wrongs you have suffered have decided to make war upon the emperor and
the Romans. Or do you not remember that you have been deprived of the
pay which has been owing you for a long time back, and that you have
been robbed of the enemy's spoil, which the law of war has set as
prizes for the dangers of battle? And that the others have claimed the
right to live sumptuously all their lives upon the good things of
victory, while you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xv_56" id="PageIV_xv_56">[56-3]</a></span>
followed as if their servants? If, now,
you are angry with me, it is within your power to vent your wrath upon
this body, and to escape the pollution of killing the others; but if
you have no charge to bring against me, it is time for you to take up
your weapons in your own behalf." So spoke Stotzas; and the soldiers
listened to his words and greeted him with great favour. And when the
commanders saw what was happening, they withdrew in silence and took
refuge in a sanctuary which was in Gazophyla. And Stotzas combined
both armies into one and then went to the commanders. And finding them
in the sanctuary, he gave pledges and then killed them all.
</p><br />
<p>XVI</p>
<p>

When the emperor learned this, he sent his nephew Germanus, a man of
patrician rank, with some few men to Libya. And Symmachus also and
Domnicus, men of the senate, followed him, the former to be prefect
and charged with the maintenance of the army, while Domnicus was to
command the infantry forces.
For John,<a name="FNanchor_55_IV" id="FNanchor_55_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_55_IV" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
who had held the office of
prefect, had already died of disease. And when they had sailed into
Carthage, Germanus counted the soldiers whom they had, and upon
looking over the books of the scribes where the names of all the
soldiers were registered, he found that the third part of the army was
in Carthage and the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xvi_3" id="PageIV_xvi_3">[3-9]</a></span>
cities, while all the rest were
arrayed with the tyrant against the Romans. He did not, therefore,
begin any fighting, but bestowed the greatest care upon his army. And
considering that those left in Carthage were the kinsmen or tentmates
of the enemy, he kept addressing many winning words to all, and in
particular said that he had himself been sent by the emperor to Libya
in order to defend the soldiers who had been wronged and to punish
those who had unprovoked done them any injury. And when this was found
out by the mutineers, they began to come over to him a few at a time.
And Germanus both received them into the city in a friendly manner
and, giving pledges, held them in honour, and he gave them their pay
for the time during which they had been in arms against the Romans.
And when the report of these acts was circulated and came to all, they
began now to detach themselves in large numbers from the tyrant and to
march to Carthage. Then at last Germanus, hoping that in the battle he
would be evenly matched in strength with his opponents, began to make
preparations for the conflict.
</p>
<p>But in the meantime Stotzas, already perceiving the trouble, and
fearing lest by the defection of still others of his soldiers the army
should be reduced still more, was pressing for a decisive encounter
immediately and trying to take hold of the war with more vigour. And
since he had some hope regarding the soldiers in Carthage, that they
would come over to him, and thought that they would readily desert if
he came near them, he held out the hope to all his men;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xvi_9" id="PageIV_xvi_9">[9-17]</a></span>
and
after encouraging them exceedingly in this way, he advanced swiftly
with his whole army against Carthage. And when he had come within
thirty-five stades of the city, he made camp not far from the sea, and
Germanus, after arming his whole army and arraying them for battle,
marched forth. And when they were all outside the city, since he had
heard what Stotzas was hoping for, he called together the whole army
and spoke as follows:</p>
<p>
"That there is nothing, fellow-soldiers, with which you can justly
reproach the emperor, and no fault which you can find with what he has
done to you, this, I think, no one of you all could deny; for it was
he who took you as you came from the fields with your wallets and one
small frock apiece and brought you together in Byzantium, and has
caused you to be so powerful that the Roman state now depends upon
you. And that he has not only been treated with wanton insult, but has
also suffered the most dreadful of all things at your hands, you
yourselves, doubtless, know full well. And desiring that you should
preserve the memory of these things for ever, he has dismissed the
accusations brought against you for your crimes, asking that this debt
alone be due to him from you&mdash;shame for what you have done. It is
reasonable, therefore, that you, being thus regarded by him, should
learn anew the lesson of good faith and correct your former folly. For
when repentance comes at the fitting time upon those who have done
wrong, it is accustomed to make those who have been injured indulgent;
and service which comes in season is wont to bring another name to
those who have been called ungrateful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xvi_18" id="PageIV_xvi_18">[18-24]</a></span></p>
<p>
"And it will be needful
for you to know well this also, that if at the present time you shew
yourselves completely loyal to the emperor, no remembrance will remain
of what has gone before. For in the nature of things every course of
action is characterized by men in accordance with its final outcome;
and while a wrong which has once been committed can never be undone in
all time, still, when it has been corrected by better deeds on the
part of those who committed it, it receives the fitting reward of
silence and generally comes to be forgotten. Moreover, if you act with
any disregard of duty toward these accursed rascals at the present
time, even though afterwards you fight through many wars in behalf of
the Romans and often win the victory over the enemy, you will never
again be regarded as having requited the emperor as you can requite
him to-day. For those who win applause in the very matter of their
former wrong-doing always gain for themselves a fairer apology. As
regards the emperor, then, let each one of you reason in some such
way. But as for me, I have not voluntarily done you any injustice, and
I have displayed my good-will to you by all possible means, and now,
facing this danger, I have decided to ask this much of you all: let no
man advance with us against the enemy contrary to his judgement. But
if anyone of you is already desirous of arraying himself with them,
without delay let him go with his weapons to the enemy's camp,
granting us this one favour, that it be not stealthily, but openly,
that he has decided to do us wrong. Indeed, it is for this reason that
I am making my speech, not in Carthage, but after coming on the
battle-field, in order that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xvi_24" id="PageIV_xvi_24">[24-5]</a></span>
might not be an obstacle to anyone
who desires to desert to our opponents, since it is possible for all
without danger to shew their disposition toward the state." Thus spoke
Germanus. And a great uproar ensued in the Roman army, for each one
demanded the right to be the first to display to the general his
loyalty to the emperor and to swear the most dread oaths in
confirmation.
</p><br />
<p>XVII</p>
<p>

Now for some time the two armies remained in position opposite each
other. But when the mutineers saw that nothing of what Stotzas had
foretold was coming to pass, they began to be afraid as having been
unexpectedly cheated of their hope, and they broke their ranks and
withdrew, and marched off to Numidia, where were their women and the
money from their booty. And Germanus too came there with the whole
army not long afterwards, having made all preparations in the best way
possible and also bringing along many wagons for the army. And
overtaking his opponents in a place which the Romans call Scalae
Veteres, he made his preparations for battle in the following manner.
Placing the wagons in line facing the front, he arrayed all the
infantry along them under the leadership of Domnicus, so that by
reason of having their rear in security they might fight with the
greater courage. And the best of the horsemen and those who had come
with him from Byzantium he himself had on the left of the infantry,
while all the others he placed on the right wing, not marshalled in
one body but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xvii_5" id="PageIV_xvii_5">[5-14]</a></span>
three divisions. And Ildiger led one of them,
Theodoras the Cappadocian another, while the remaining one, which was
larger, was commanded by John, the brother of Pappus, with three
others. Thus did the Romans array themselves.
</p>
<p>And the mutineers took their stand opposite them, not in order,
however, but scattered, more in the manner of barbarians. And at no
great distance many thousands of Moors followed them, who were
commanded by a number of leaders, and especially by Iaudas and
Ortaas. But not all of them, as it happened, were faithful to Stotzas
and his men, for many had sent previously to Germanus and agreed that,
when they came into the fight, they would array themselves with the
emperor's army against the enemy. However, Germanus could not trust
them altogether, for the Moorish nation is by nature faithless to all
men. It was for this reason also that they did not array themselves
with the mutineers, but remained behind, waiting for what would come
to pass, in order that with those who should be victorious they might
join in the pursuit of the vanquished. Such was the purpose, then, of
the Moors, in following behind and not mingling with the mutineers.
</p>
<p>And when Stotzas came close to the enemy and saw the standard of
Germanus, he exhorted his men and began to charge against him. But the
mutinous Eruli who were arrayed about him did not follow and even
tried with all their might to prevent him, saying that they did not
know the character of the forces of Germanus, but that they did know
that those arrayed on the enemy's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xvii_14" id="PageIV_xvii_14">[14-21]</a></span>
right would by no means
withstand them. If, therefore, they should advance against these, they
would not only give way themselves and turn to flight, but would also,
in all probability, throw the rest of the Roman army into confusion;
but if they should attack Germanus and be driven back and put to rout,
their whole cause would be ruined on the spot. And Stotzas was
persuaded by these words, and permitted the others to fight with the
men of Germanus, while he himself with the best men went against John
and those arrayed with him. And they failed to withstand the attack
and hastened to flee in complete disorder. And the mutineers took all
their standards immediately, and pursued them as they fled at top
speed, while some too charged upon the infantry, who had already begun
to abandon their ranks. But at this juncture Germanus himself, drawing
his sword and urging the whole of that part of the army to do the
same, with great difficulty routed the mutineers opposed to him and
advanced on the run against Stotzas. And then, since he was joined in
this effort by the men of Ildiger and Theodorus, the two armies
mingled with each other in such a way that, while the mutineers were
pursuing some of their enemy, they were being overtaken and killed by
others. And as the confusion became greater and greater, the troops of
Germanus, who were in the rear, pressed on still more, and the
mutineers, falling into great fear, thought no longer of resistance.
But neither side could be distinguished either by their own comrades
or by their opponents. For all used one language and the same
equipment of arms, and they differed neither in figure nor in dress
nor in any other thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xvii_21" id="PageIV_xvii_21">[21-40]</a></span>
whatever. For this reason the soldiers of
the emperor by the advice of Germanus, whenever they captured anyone,
asked who he was; and then, if he said that he was a soldier of
Germanus, they bade him give the watchword of Germanus, and if he was
not at all able to give this, they killed him instantly. In this
struggle one of the enemy got by unnoticed and killed the horse of
Germanus, and Germanus himself fell to the ground and came into
danger, and would have been lost had not his guards quickly saved him
by forming an enclosure around him and mounting him on another horse.
</p>
<p>As for Stotzas, he succeeded in this tumult in escaping with a few
men. But Germanus, urging on his men, went straight for the enemy's
camp. There he was encountered by those of the mutineers who had been
stationed to guard the stockade. A stubborn fight took place around
its entrance, and the mutineers came within a little of forcing back
their opponents, but Germanus sent some of his followers and bade them
make trial of the camp at another point. These men, since no one was
defending the camp at this place, got inside the stockade with little
trouble. And the mutineers, upon seeing them, rushed off in flight,
and Germanus with all the rest of the army dashed into the enemy's
camp. There the soldiers, finding it easy to plunder the goods of the
camp, neither took any account of the enemy nor paid any further heed
to the exhortations of their general, since booty was at hand. For
this reason Germanus, fearing lest the enemy should get together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xvii_30" id="PageIV_xvii_30">[30-3]</a></span>
and come upon them, himself with some few men took his stand at the
entrance of the stockade, uttering many laments and urging his
unheeding men to return to good order. And many of the Moors, when the
rout had taken place in this way, were now pursuing the mutineers,
and, arraying themselves with the emperor's troops, were plundering
the camp of the vanquished. But Stotzas, at first having confidence in
the Moorish army, rode to them in order to renew the battle. But
perceiving what was being done, he fled with a hundred men, and
succeeded with difficulty in making his escape. And once more many
gathered about him and attempted to engage with the enemy, but being
repulsed no less decisively than before, if not even more so, they all
came over to Germanus. And Stotzas alone with some few Vandals
withdrew to Mauretania, and taking to wife the daughter of one of the
rulers, remained there. And this was the conclusion of that mutiny.
</p><br />
<p>XVIII</p>
<p>

Now there was among the body-guards of Theodorus, the Cappadocian, a
certain Maximinus, an exceedingly base man. This Maximinus had first
got a very large number of the soldiers to join with him in a
conspiracy against the government, and was now purposing to attempt a
tyranny. And being eager to associate with himself still more men, he
explained the project to others and especially to Asclepiades, a
native of Palestine, who was a man of good birth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xviii_3" id="PageIV_xviii_3">[3-10]</a></span>
the first
of the personal friends of Theodorus. Now Asclepiades, after
conversing with Theodorus, straightway reported the whole matter to
Germanus. And he, not wishing as yet, while affairs were still
unsettled, to begin any other disturbance, decided to get the best of
the man by cajoling and flattering him rather than by punishment, and
to bind him by oaths to loyalty toward the government. Accordingly,
since it was an old custom among all Romans that no one should become
a body-guard of one of the commanders, unless he had previously taken
the most dread oaths and given pledges of his loyalty both toward his
own commander and toward the Roman emperor, he summoned Maximinus, and
praising him for his daring, directed him to be one of his body-guards
from that time forth. And he, being overjoyed at the extraordinary
honour, and conjecturing that his project would in this way get on
more easily, took the oath, and though from that time forth he was
counted among the body-guards of Germanus, he did not hesitate to
disregard his oaths immediately and to strengthen much more than ever
his plans to achieve the tyranny.
</p>
<p>Now the whole city was celebrating some general festival, and many of
the conspirators of Maximinus at about the time of lunch came
according to their agreement to the palace, where Germanus was
entertaining his friends at a feast, and Maximinus took his stand
beside the couches with the other body-guards. And as the drinking
proceeded, someone entered and announced to Germanus that many
soldiers were standing in great disorder before the door of the court,
putting forward the charge that the government owed them their pay for
a long period. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xviii_10" id="PageIV_xviii_10">[10-18]</a></span>
he commanded the most trusty of the guards
secretly to keep close watch over Maximinus, allowing him in no way to
perceive what was being done. Then the conspirators with threats and
tumult proceeded on the run to the hippodrome, and those who shared
their plan with them gathered gradually from the houses and were
assembling there. And if it had so chanced that all of them had come
together, no one, I think, would have been able easily to destroy
their power; but, as it was, Germanus anticipated this, and, before
the greater part had yet arrived, he straightway sent against them all
who were well-disposed to himself and to the emperor. And they
attacked the conspirators before they expected them. And then, since
Maximinus, for whom they were waiting to begin the battle for them,
was not with them, and they did not see the crowd gathered to help
them, as they had thought it would be, but instead even beheld their
fellow-soldiers unexpectedly fighting against them, they consequently
lost heart and were easily overcome in the struggle and rushed off in
flight and in complete disorder. And their opponents slew many of
them, and they also captured many alive and brought them to Germanus.
Those, however, who had not already come to the hippodrome gave no
indication of their sentiment toward Maximinus. And Germanus did not
see fit to go on and seek them out, but he enquired whether Maximinus,
since he had sworn the oath, had taken part in the plot. And since it
was proved that, though numbered among his own body-guards he had
carried on his designs still more than before, Germanus impaled him
close by the fortifications of Carthage, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xviii_18" id="PageIV_xviii_18">[18-6]</a></span>
this way
succeeded completely in putting down the sedition. As for Maximinus,
then, such was the end of his plot.
</p><br />
<p>XIX</p>
<p>

And the emperor summoned Germanus together with Symmachus and Domnicus
and again entrusted all Libya to Solomon, in the thirteenth year of
his reign; and he provided him with an army and officers, among whom
were Rufinus and Leontius, the sons of Zaunas the son of Pharesmanas,
and John, the son of Sisiniolus.
<span class="sidenote">539-540 A.D.</span>
For Martinus and Valerianus had already before this gone under summons
to Byzantium. And Solomon sailed to Carthage, and having rid himself
of the sedition of Stotzas, he ruled with moderation and guarded Libya
securely, setting the army in order, and sending to Byzantium and to
Belisarius whatever suspicious elements he found in it, and enrolling
new soldiers to equal their number, and removing those of the Vandals
who were left and especially all their women from the whole of Libya.
And he surrounded each city with a wall, and guarding the laws with
great strictness, he restored the government completely. And Libya
became under his rule powerful as to its revenues and prosperous in
other respects.
</p>
<p>And when everything had been arranged by him in the best way possible,
he again made an expedition against Iaudas and the Moors on Aurasium.
And first he sent forward Gontharis, one of his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xix_6" id="PageIV_xix_6">[6-15]</a></span>
 body-guards
and an able warrior, with an army. Now Gontharis came to the Abigas
River and made camp near Bagas, a deserted city. And there he engaged
with the enemy, but was defeated in battle, and retiring to his
stockade was already being hard pressed by the siege of the Moors. But
afterwards Solomon himself arrived with his whole army, and when he
was sixty stades away from the camp which Gontharis was commanding, he
made a stockade and remained there; and hearing all that had befallen
the force of Gontharis, he sent them a part of his army and bade them
keep up the fight against the enemy with courage. But the Moors,
having gained the upper hand in the engagement, as I have said, did as
follows. The Abigas River flows from Aurasium, and descending into a
plain, waters the land just as the men there desire. For the natives
conduct this stream to whatever place they think it will best serve
them at the moment, for in this plain there are many channels, into
which the Abigas is divided, and entering all of them, it passes
underground, and reappears again above the ground and gathers its
stream together. This takes place over the greatest part of the plain
and makes it possible for the inhabitants of the region, by stopping
up the waterways with earth, or by again opening them, to make use of
the waters of this river as they wish. So at that time the Moors shut
off all the channels there and thus allowed the whole stream to flow
about the camp of the Romans. As a result of this, a deep, muddy marsh
formed there through which it was impossible to go; this terrified
them exceedingly and reduced them to a state of helplessness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xix_15" id="PageIV_xix_15">[15-21]</a></span>
When this was heard by Solomon, he came quickly. But the
barbarians, becoming afraid, withdrew to the foot of Aurasium. And in
a place which they call Babosis they made camp and remained there. So
Solomon moved with his whole army and came to that place. And upon
engaging with the enemy, he defeated them decisively and turned them
to flight. Now after this the Moors did not think it advisable for
them to fight a pitched battle with the Romans; for they did not hope
to overcome them in this kind of contest; but they did have hope,
based on the difficult character of the country around Aurasium, that
the Romans would in a short time give up by reason of the sufferings
they would have to endure and would withdraw from there, just as they
formerly had done. The most of them, therefore, went off to Mauretania
and the barbarians to the south of Aurasium, but Iaudas with twenty
thousand of the Moors remained there. And it happened that he had
built a fortress on Aurasium, Zerboule by name. Into this he entered
with all the Moors and remained quiet. But Solomon was by no means
willing that time should be wasted in the siege, and learning that the
plains about the city of Tamougade were full of grain just becoming
ripe, he led his army into them, and settling himself there, began to
plunder the land. Then, after firing everything, he returned again to
the fortress of Zerboule.
</p>
<p>But during this time, while the Romans were plundering the land,
Iaudas, leaving behind some of the Moors, about as many as he thought
would be sufficient for the defence of the fortress, himself ascended
to the summit of Aurasium with the rest of the army, not wishing to
stand siege in the fort and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xix_21" id="PageIV_xix_21">[21-31]</a></span>
have provisions fail his forces. And
finding a high place with cliff's on all sides of it and concealed by
perpendicular rocks, Toumar by name, he remained quietly there. And
the Romans besieged the fortress of Zerboule for three days. And using
their bows, since the wall was not high, they hit many of the
barbarians upon the parapets. And by some chance it happened that all
the leaders of the Moors were hit by these missiles and died. And when
the three days' time had passed and night came on, the Romans, having
learned nothing of the death of the leaders among the Moors, were
planning to break up the siege. For it seemed better to Solomon to go
against Iaudas and the multitude of the Moors, thinking that, if he
should be able to capture that force by siege, the barbarians in
Zerboule would with less trouble and difficulty yield to the Romans.
But the barbarians, thinking that they could no longer hold out
against the siege, since all their leaders had now been destroyed,
decided to flee with all speed and abandon the fortress. Accordingly
they fled immediately in silence and without allowing the enemy in any
way to perceive it, and the Romans also at daybreak began to prepare
for departure. And since no one appeared on the wall, although the
besieging army was withdrawing, they began to wonder and fell into the
greatest perplexity among themselves. And in this state of uncertainty
they went around the fortress and found the gate open from which the
Moors had departed in flight. And entering the fortress they treated
everything as plunder, but they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xix_31" id="PageIV_xix_31">[31-5]</a></span>
no thought of pursuing the
enemy, for they had set out with light equipment and were familiar
with the country round about. And when they had plundered everything,
they set guards over the fortress, and all moved forward on foot.
</p><br />
<p>XX</p>
<p>

And coming to the place Toumar, where the enemy had shut themselves in
and were remaining quiet, they encamped near by in a bad position,
where there would be no supply of water, except a little, nor any
other necessary thing. And after much time had been spent and the
barbarians did not come out against them at all, they themselves, no
less than the enemy, if not even more, were hard pressed by the siege
and began to be impatient. And more than anything else, they were
distressed by the lack of water; this Solomon himself guarded, giving
each day no more than a single cupful to each man. And since he saw
that they were openly discontented and no longer able to bear their
present hardships, he planned to make trial of the place, although it
was difficult of access, and called all together and exhorted them as
follows: "Since God has granted to the Romans to besiege the Moors on
Aurasium, a thing which hitherto has been beyond hope and now, to such
as do not see what is actually being done, is altogether incredible,
it is necessary that we too should lend our aid to the help that has
come from above, and not prove false to this favour, but undergoing
the danger with enthusiasm, should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xx_5" id="PageIV_xx_5">[5-13]</a></span>
reach after the good fortune
which is to come from success. For in every case the turning of the
scales of human affairs depends upon the moment of opportunity; but if
a man, by wilful cowardice, is traitor to his fortune, he cannot
justly blame it, having by his own action brought the guilt upon
himself. Now as for the Moors, you see their weakness surely and the
place in which they have shut themselves up and are keeping guard,
deprived of all the necessities of life. And as for you, one of two
things is necessary, either without feeling any vexation at the siege
to await the surrender of the enemy, or, if you shrink from this, to
accept the victory which goes with the danger. And fighting against
these barbarians will be the more free from danger for us, inasmuch as
they are already fighting with hunger and I think they will never even
come to an engagement with us. Having these things in mind at the
present time, it behooves you to execute all your orders with
eagerness."
</p>
<p>After Solomon had made this exhortation, he looked about to see from
what point it would be best for his men to make an attempt on the
place, and for a long time he seemed to be in perplexity. For the
difficult nature of the ground seemed to him quite too much to contend
with. But while Solomon was considering this, chance provided a way
for the enterprise as follows. There was a certain Gezon in the army,
a foot-soldier, "optio"<a name="FNanchor_56_IV" id="FNanchor_56_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_56_IV" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
of the detachment to which Solomon
belonged; for thus the Romans call the paymaster. This Gezon, either
in play or in anger, or perhaps even moved by some divine impulse,
began to make the ascent alone, apparently going against the enemy,
and not far from him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xx_13" id="PageIV_xx_13">[13-22]</a></span>
went some of his fellow-soldiers,
marvelling greatly at what he was doing. And three of the Moors, who
had been stationed to guard the approach, suspecting that the man was
coming against them, went on the run to confront him. But since they
were in a narrow way, they did not proceed in orderly array, but each
one went separately. And Gezon struck the first one who came upon him
and killed him, and in this way he despatched each of the others. And
when those in the rear perceived this, they advanced with much
shouting and tumult against the enemy. And when the whole Roman army
both heard and saw what was being done, without waiting either for the
general to lead the way for them or for the trumpets to give the
signal for battle, as was customary, nor indeed even keeping their
order, but making a great uproar and urging one another on, they ran
against the enemy's camp. There Rufinus and Leontius, the sons of
Zaunas the son of Pharesmanes, made a splendid display of valorous
deeds against the enemy. And by this the Moors were terror-stricken,
and when they learned that their guards also had been destroyed, they
straightway turned to flight where each one could, and the most of
them were overtaken in the difficult ground and killed. And Iaudas
himself, though struck by a javelin in the thigh, still made his
escape and withdrew to Mauretania. But the Romans, after plundering
the enemy's camp, decided not to abandon Aurasium again, but to guard
fortresses which Solomon was to build there, so that this mountain
might not be again accessible to the Moors.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xx_23" id="PageIV_xx_23">[23-30]</a></span></p>
<p>
Now there is on Aurasium a perpendicular rock which rises in
the midst of precipices; the natives call it the Rock of Geminianus;
there the men of ancient times had built a tower, making it very small
as a place of refuge, strong and unassailable, since the nature of the
position assisted them. Here, as it happened, Iaudas had a few days
previously deposited his money and his women, setting one old Moor in
charge as guardian of the money. For he could never have suspected
that the enemy would either reach this place, or that they could in
all time capture the tower by force. But the Romans at that time,
searching through the rough country of Aurasium, came there, and one
of them, with a laugh, attempted to climb up to the tower; but the
women began to taunt him, ridiculing him as attempting the impossible;
and the old man, peering out from the tower, did the same thing. But
when the Roman soldier, climbing with both hands and feet, had come
near them, he drew his sword quietly and leaped forward as quickly as
he could, and struck the old man a fair blow on the neck, and
succeeded in cutting it through. And the head fell down to the ground,
and the soldiers, now emboldened and holding to one another, ascended
to the tower, and took out from there both the women and the money, of
which there was an exceedingly great quantity. And by means of it
Solomon surrounded many of the cities in Libya with walls.
</p>
<p>And after the Moors had retired from Numidia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xx_30" id="PageIV_xx_30">[30-2]</a></span>
defeated in the manner
described, the land of Zabe, which is
beyond Mt. Aurasium and is called "First Mauretania," whose metropolis
is Sitiphis,<a name="FNanchor_57_IV" id="FNanchor_57_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_57_IV" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
was added to the Roman empire by Solomon as a
tributary province; for of the other Mauretania Caesarea is the first
city, where was
settled Mastigas<a name="FNanchor_58_IV" id="FNanchor_58_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_58_IV" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
with his Moors, having the whole
country there subject and tributary to him, except, indeed, the city
of Caesarea. For this city Belisarius had previously recovered for the
Romans, as has been set forth in the
previous narrative<a name="FNanchor_59_IV" id="FNanchor_59_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_59_IV" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>;
and the
Romans always journey to this city in ships, but they are not able to
go by land, since Moors dwell in that country. And as a result of this
all the Libyans who were subjects of the Romans, coming to enjoy
secure peace and finding the rule of Solomon wise and very moderate,
and having no longer any thought of hostility in their minds, seemed
the most fortunate of all men.
</p><br />
<p>XXI</p>
<p>

But in the fourth year after this it came about that all their
blessings were turned to the opposite.</p>
 <span class="sidenote">543-544 A.D.</span>

<p>For in the seventeenth year of the reign of the Emperor Justinian,
Cyrus and Sergius, the sons of Bacchus, Solomon's brother, were
assigned by the emperor to rule over the cities in Libya, Cyrus, the
elder, to have Pentapolis,<a name="FNanchor_60_IV" id="FNanchor_60_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_60_IV" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
and Sergius Tripolis. And the Moors who
are called Leuathae came to Sergius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxi_2" id="PageIV_xxi_2">[2-19]</a></span>
with a great army at the city of
Leptimagna,<a name="FNanchor_61_IV" id="FNanchor_61_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_61_IV" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
spreading the report that the reason they had come was
this, that Sergius might give them the gifts and insignia of office
which were customary<a name="FNanchor_62_IV" id="FNanchor_62_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_62_IV" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
and so make the peace secure. But Sergius,
persuaded by Pudentius, a man of Tripolis, of whom I made mention in
the preceding narrative<a name="FNanchor_63_IV" id="FNanchor_63_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_63_IV" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
as having served the Emperor Justinian
against the Vandals at the beginning of the Vandalic War, received
eighty of the barbarians, their most notable men, into the city,
promising to fulfil all their demands; but he commanded the rest to
remain in the suburb. Then after giving these eighty men pledges
concerning the peace, he invited them to a banquet. But they say that
these barbarians had come into the city with treacherous intent, that
they might lay a trap for Sergius and kill him. And when they came
into conference with him, they called up many charges against the
Romans, and in particular said that their crops had been plundered
wrongfully. And Sergius, paying no heed to these things, rose from the
seat on which he was sitting, with intent to go away. And one of the
barbarians, laying hold upon his shoulder, attempted to prevent him
from going. Then the others began to shout in confusion, and were
already rushing together about him. But one of the body-guards of
Sergius, drawing his sword, despatched that Moor. And as a result of
this a great tumult, as was natural, arose in the room, and the guards
of Sergius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxi_10" id="PageIV_xxi_10">[10-17]</a></span>
killed all the barbarians. But one of them, upon seeing the
others being slain, rushed out of the house where these things were
taking place, unnoticed by anyone, and coming to his tribemates,
revealed what had befallen their fellows. And when they heard this,
they betook themselves on the run to their own camp and together with
all the others arrayed themselves in arms against the Romans. Now when
they came near the city of Leptimagna, Sergius and Pudentius
confronted them with their whole army. And the battle becoming a
hand-to-hand fight, at first the Romans were victorious and slew many
of the enemy, and, plundering their camp, secured their goods and
enslaved an exceedingly great number of women and children. But
afterwards Pudentius, being possessed by a spirit of reckless daring,
was killed; and Sergius with the Roman army, since it was already
growing dark, marched into Leptimagna.
</p>
<p>At a later time the barbarians took the field against the Romans with
a greater array. And Sergius went to join his uncle Solomon, in order
that he too might go to meet the enemy with a larger army; and he
found there his brother Cyrus also. And the barbarians, coming into
Byzacium, made raids and plundered a great part of the country there;
and Antalas (whom I mentioned in the preceding
narrative<a name="FNanchor_64_IV" id="FNanchor_64_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_64_IV" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
as having
remained faithful to the Romans and as being for this reason sole
ruler of the Moors in Byzacium) had by now, as it happened, become
hostile to Solomon, because Solomon had deprived him of the
maintenance with which the emperor had honoured him and had killed his
brother, charging him with responsibility for an uprising against the
people of Byzacium.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxi_17" id="PageIV_xxi_17">[17-23]</a></span>
So at that time Antalas was pleased to see these barbarians,
and making an offensive and defensive alliance with them, led them
against Solomon and Carthage.
</p>
<p>And Solomon, as soon as he heard about this, put his whole army in
motion and marched against them, and coming upon them at the city of
Tebesta, distant six days' journey from Carthage, he established his
camp in company with the sons of his brother Bacchus, Cyrus and
Sergius and Solomon the younger. And fearing the multitude of the
barbarians, he sent to the leaders of the Leuathae, reproaching them
because, while at peace with the Romans, they had taken up arms and
come against them, and demanding that they should confirm the peace
existing between the two peoples, and he promised to swear the most
dread oaths, that he would hold no remembrance of what they had done.
But the barbarians, mocking his words, said that he would of course
swear by the sacred writings of the Christians, which they are
accustomed to call Gospels. Now since Sergius had once taken these
oaths and then had slain those
who trusted in them,<a name="FNanchor_65_IV" id="FNanchor_65_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_65_IV" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
it was their
desire to go into battle and make a test of these same sacred
writings, to see what sort of power they had against the perjurers, in
order that they might first have absolute confidence in them before
they finally entered into the agreement. When Solomon heard this, he
made his preparations for the combat.
</p>
<p>And on the following day he engaged with a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxi_23" id="PageIV_xxi_23">[23-2]</a></span>
portion of the enemy as they were bringing in a very large
booty, conquered them in battle, seized all their booty and kept it
under guard. And when the soldiers were dissatisfied and counted it an
outrage that he did not give them the plunder, he said that he was
awaiting the outcome of the war, in order that they might distribute
everything then, according to the share that should seem to suit the
merit of each. But when the barbarians advanced a second time, with
their whole army, to give battle, this time some of the Romans stayed
behind and the others entered the encounter with no enthusiasm. At
first, then, the battle was evenly contested, but later, since the
Moors were vastly superior by reason of their great numbers, the most
of the Romans fled, and though Solomon and a few men about him held
out for a time against the missiles of the barbarians, afterwards they
were overpowered by the enemy, and fleeing in haste, reached a ravine
made by a brook which flowed in that region. And there Solomon's horse
stumbled and threw him to the ground, and his body-guards lifted him
quickly in their arms and set him upon his horse. But overcome by
great pain and unable to hold the reins longer, he was overtaken and
killed by the barbarians, and many of his guards besides. Such was the
end of Solomon's life.
</p><br />
<p>XXII</p>
<p>

After the death of Solomon, Sergius, who, as has been said, was his
nephew, took over the government of Libya by gift of the emperor. And
this man became the chief cause of great ruin to the people of Libya,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxii_2" id="PageIV_xxii_2">[2-8]</a></span>
and all were dissatisfied with his rule&mdash;the officers because,
being exceedingly stupid and young both in character and in years, he
proved to be the greatest braggart of all men, and he insulted them
for no just cause and disregarded them, always using the power of his
wealth and the authority of his office to this end; and the soldiers
disliked him because he was altogether unmanly and weak; and the
Libyans, not only for these reasons, but also because he had shown
himself strangely fond of the wives and the possessions of others. But
most of all John, the son of Sisiniolus, was hostile to the power of
Sergius; for, though he was an able warrior and was a man of unusually
fair repute, he found Sergius absolutely ungrateful. For this reason
neither he nor anyone else at all was willing to take up arms against
the enemy. But almost all the Moors were following Antalas, and
Stotzas came at his summons from Mauretania. And since not one of the
enemy came out against them, they began to sack the country, making
plunder of everything without fear. At that time Antalas sent to the
Emperor Justinian a letter, which set forth the following:</p>
<p>
"That I am a slave of thy empire not even I myself would deny, but the
Moors, having suffered unholy treatment at the hands of Solomon in
time of peace, have taken up arms under the most severe constraint,
not lifting them against thee, but warding off our personal enemy; and
this is especially true of me. For he not only decided to deprive me
of the maintenance, which Belisarius long before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxii_8" id="PageIV_xxii_8">[8-15]</a></span>
specified and
thou didst grant, but he also killed my own brother, although he had
no wrongdoing to charge against him. We have therefore taken vengeance
upon him who wronged us. And if it is thy will that the Moors be in
subjection to thy empire and serve it in all things as they are
accustomed to do, command Sergius, the nephew of Solomon, to depart
from here and return to thee, and send another general to Libya. For
thou wilt not be lacking in men of discretion and more worthy than
Sergius in every way; for as long as this man commands thy army, it is
impossible for peace to be established between the Romans and the
Moors."
</p>
<p>Such was the letter written by Antalas. But the emperor, even after
reading these things and learning the common enmity of all toward
Sergius, was still unwilling to remove him from his office, out of
respect for the virtues of Solomon and especially the manner of his
death. Such, then, was the course of these events.
</p>
<p>But Solomon, the brother of Sergius, who was supposed to have
disappeared from the world together with his uncle Solomon, was
forgotten by his brother and by the rest as well; for no one had
learned that he was alive. But the Moors, as it happened, had taken
him alive, since he was very young; and they enquired of him who he
was. And he said that he was a Vandal by birth, and a slave of
Solomon. He said, moreover, that he had a friend, a physician,
Pegasius by name, in the city of Laribus near by, who would purchase
him by giving ransom. So the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxii_15" id="PageIV_xxii_15">[15-1]</a></span>
Moors came up close to the
fortifications of the city and called Pegasius and displayed Solomon
to him, and asked whether it was his pleasure to purchase the man. And
since he agreed to purchase him, they sold Solomon to him for fifty
pieces of gold. But upon getting inside the fortifications, Solomon
taunted the Moors as having been deceived by him, a mere lad; for he
said that he was no other than Solomon, the son of Bacchus and nephew
of Solomon. And the Moors, being deeply stung by what had happened,
and counting it a terrible thing that, while having a strong security
for the conduct of Sergius and the Romans, they had relinquished it so
carelessly, came to Laribus and laid siege to the place, in order to
capture Solomon with the city. And the besieged, in terror at being
shut in by the barbarians, for they had not even carried in
provisions, as it happened, opened negotiations with the Moors,
proposing that upon receiving a great sum of money they should
straightway abandon the siege. Whereupon the barbarians, thinking that
they could never take the city by force&mdash;for the Moors are not at all
practised in the storming of walls&mdash;and at the same time not knowing
that provisions were scarce for the besieged, welcomed their words,
and when they had received three thousand pieces of gold, they
abandoned the siege, and all the Leuathae retired homeward.
</p><br />
<p>XXIII</p>
<p>

But Antalas and the army of the Moors were gathering again in Byzacium
and Stotzas was with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxiii_1" id="PageIV_xxiii_1">[1-10]</a></span>
them, having some few soldiers and Vandals.
And John, the son of Sisiniolus, being earnestly entreated by the
Libyans, gathered an army and marched against them. Now Himerius, the
Thracian, was commander of the troops in Byzacium, and at that time he
was ordered by John to bring with him all the troops there, together
with the commanders of each detachment, and come to a place called
Menephesse, which is in Byzacium, and join his force there. But later,
upon hearing that the enemy were encamped there, John wrote to
Himerius telling what had happened and directing him to unite with his
forces at another place, that they might not go separately, but all
together, to encounter the enemy. But by some chance those who had
this letter, making use of another road, were quite unable to find
Himerius, and he together with his army, coming upon the camp of the
enemy, fell into their hands. Now there was in this Roman army a
certain youth, Severianus, son of Asiaticus, a Phoenician and a native
of Emesa, commanding a detachment of horse. This man alone, together
with the soldiers under him, fifty in number, engaged with the enemy.
And for some time they held out, but later, being overpowered by the
great multitude, they ran to the top of a hill in the neighbourhood on
which there was also a fort, but one which offered no security. For
this reason they surrendered themselves to their opponents when they
ascended the hill to attack them. And the Moors killed neither him nor
any of the soldiers, but they made prisoners of the whole force; and
Himerius they kept under guard, and handed over his soldiers to
Stotzas, since they agreed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxiii_10" id="PageIV_xxiii_10">[10-17]</a></span>
great readiness to march with
the rebels against the Romans; Himerius, however, they threatened with
death, if he should not carry out their commands. And they commanded
him to put into their hands by some device the city of Hadrumetum on
the sea. And since he declared that he was willing, they went with him
against Hadrumetum. And upon coming near the city, they sent Himerius
a little in advance with some of the soldiers of Stotzas, dragging
along, as it seemed, some Moors in chains, and they themselves
followed behind. And they directed Himerius to say to those in command
of the gates of the city that the emperor's army had won a decisive
victory, and that John would come very soon, bringing an innumerable
multitude of Moorish captives; and when in this manner the gates had
been opened to them, he was to get inside the fortifications together
with those who went with him. And he carried out these instructions.
And the citizens of Hadrumetum, being deceived in this way (for they
could not distrust the commander of all the troops in Byzacium),
opened wide the gates and received the enemy. Then, indeed, those who
had entered with Himerius drew their swords and would not allow the
guards there to shut the gates again, but straightway received the
whole army of the Moors into the city. And the barbarians, after
plundering it and establishing there some few guards, departed. And of
the Romans who had been captured some few escaped and came to
Carthage, among whom were Severianus and Himerius. For it was not
difficult for those who wished it to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxiii_17" id="PageIV_xxiii_17">[17-23]</a></span>
their escape from
Moors. And many also, not at all unwillingly, remained with Stotzas.
</p>
<p>Not long after this one of the priests, Paulus by name, who had been
appointed to take charge of the sick, in conferring with some of the
nobles, said: "I myself shall journey to Carthage and I am hopeful
that I shall return quickly with an army, and it will be your care to
receive the emperor's forces into the city." So they attached some
ropes to him and let him down by night from the fortifications, and
he, coming to the sea-shore and happening upon a fishing-vessel which
was thereabouts, won over the masters of this boat by great sums of
money and sailed off to Carthage. And when he had landed there and
come into the presence of Sergius, he told the whole story and asked
him to give him a considerable army in order to recover Hadrumetum.
And since this by no means pleased Sergius, inasmuch as the army in
Carthage was not great, the priest begged him to give him some few
soldiers, and receiving not more than eighty men, he formed the
following plan. He collected a large number of boats and skiffs and
embarked on them many sailors and Libyans also, clad in the garments
which the Roman soldiers are accustomed to wear. And setting off with
the whole fleet, he sailed at full speed straight for Hadrumetum. And
when he had come close to it, he sent some men stealthily and declared
to the notables of the city that Germanus, the emperor's nephew, had
recently come to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxiii_23" id="PageIV_xxiii_23">[23-32]</a></span>
Carthage, and had sent a very considerable army
to the citizens of Hadrumetum. And he bade them take courage at this
and open for them one small gate that night. And they carried out his
orders. Thus Paulus with his followers got inside the fortifications,
and he slew all the enemy and recovered Hadrumetum for the emperor;
and the rumour about Germanus, beginning there, went even to Carthage.
And the Moors, as well as Stotzas and his followers, upon hearing
this, at first became terrified and went off in flight to the
extremities of Libya, but later, upon learning the truth, they counted
it a terrible thing that they, after sparing all the citizens of
Hadrumetum, had suffered such things at their hands. For this reason
they made raids everywhere and wrought unholy deeds upon the Libyans,
sparing no one whatever his age, and the land became at that time for
the most part depopulated. For of the Libyans who had been left some
fled into the cities and some to Sicily and the other islands. But
almost all the notables came to Byzantium, among whom was Paulus also,
who had recovered Hadrumetum for the emperor. And the Moors with still
less fear, since no one came out against them, were plundering
everything, and with them Stotzas, who was now powerful. For many
Roman soldiers were following him, some who had come as deserters, and
others who had been in the beginning captives but now remained with
him of their own free will. And John, who was indeed a man of some
reputation among the Moors, was remaining quiet because of the extreme
hostility he had conceived against Sergius.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxiv_1" id="PageIV_xxiv_1">[1-7]</a></span>
</p><br />
<p>XXIV</p>
<p>

At this time the emperor sent to Libya, with some few soldiers,
another general, Areobindus, a man of the senate and of good birth,
but not at all skilled in matters of warfare. And he sent with him
Athanasius, a prefect, who had come recently from Italy, and some few
Armenians led by Artabanes and John, sons of John, of the line of the
Arsacidae,<a name="FNanchor_66_IV" id="FNanchor_66_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_66_IV" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
who had recently left the Persian army and as deserters
had come back to the Romans, together with the other Armenians. And
with Areobindus was his sister and Prejecta, his wife, who was the
daughter of Vigilantia, the sister of the Emperor Justinian. The
emperor, however, did not recall Sergius, but commanded both him and
Areobindus to be generals of Libya, dividing the country and the
detachments of soldiers between them. And he enjoined upon Sergius to
carry on the war against the barbarians in Numidia, and upon
Areobindus to direct his operations constantly against the Moors in
Byzacium. And when this expedition lauded at Carthage, Sergius
departed forthwith for Numidia with his own army, and Areobindus, upon
learning that Antalas and Stotzas were encamped near the city of
Siccaveneria, which is three days' journey distant from Carthage,
commanded John, the son of Sisiniolus, to go against them, choosing
out whatever was best of the army; and he wrote to Sergius to unite
with the forces of John, in order that they might all with one common
force engage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxiv_7" id="PageIV_xxiv_7">[7-15]</a></span>
with the enemy. Now Sergius decided to pay no heed
to the message and have nothing to do with this affair, and John with
a small army was compelled to engage with an innumerable host of the
enemy. And there had always been great enmity between him and Stotzas,
and each one used to pray that he might become the slayer of the other
before departing from the world. At that time, accordingly, as soon as
the fighting was about to come to close quarters, both rode out from
their armies and came against each other. And John drew his bow, and,
as Stotzas was still advancing, made a successful shot and hit him in
the right groin, and Stotzas, mortally wounded, fell there, not yet
dead, but destined to survive this wound only a little time. And all
came up immediately, both the Moorish army and those who followed
Stotzas, and placing Stotzas with little life in him against a tree,
they advanced upon their enemy with great fury; and since they were
far superior in numbers, they routed John and all the Romans with no
difficulty. Then, indeed, they say, John remarked that death had now a
certain sweetness for him, since his prayer regarding Stotzas had
reached fulfilment. And there was a steep place near by, where his
horse stumbled and threw him off. And as he was trying to leap upon
the horse again, the enemy caught and killed him, a man who had shown
himself great both in reputation and in valour. And Stotzas learned
this and then died, remarking only that now it was most sweet to die.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxiv_15" id="PageIV_xxiv_15">[15-4]</a></span>
In this battle John, the Armenian, brother of Artabanes, also
died, after making a display of valorous deeds against the enemy. And
the emperor, upon hearing this, was very deeply grieved because of the
valour of John; and thinking it inexpedient for the two generals to
administer the province, he immediately recalled Sergius and sent him
to Italy with an army, and gave over the whole power of Libya to
Areobindus.
</p><br />
<p>XXV</p>
<p>

And two months after Sergius had departed from there, Gontharis
essayed to set up a tyranny in the following manner. He himself, as it
happened, was commanding the troops in Numidia and spending his time
there for that reason, but he was secretly treating with the Moors
that they might march against Carthage. Forthwith, therefore, an army
of the enemy, having been gathered into one place from Numidia and
Byzacium, went with great zeal against Carthage. And the Numidians
were commanded by Coutzinas and Iaudas, and the men of Byzacium by
Antalas. And with him was also John, the tyrant, and his followers;
for the mutineers, after the death of Stotzas, had set him up as ruler
over themselves. And when Areobindus learned of their attack, he
summoned to Carthage a number of the officers with their men, and
among them Gontharis. And he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxv_4" id="PageIV_xxv_4">[4-11]</a></span>
joined also by Artabanes and
the Armenians. Areobindus, accordingly, bade Gontharis lead the whole
army against the enemy. And Gontharis, though he had promised to serve
him zealously in the war, proceeded to act as follows. One of his
servants, a Moor by birth and a cook by trade, he commanded to go to
the enemy's camp, and to make it appear to all others that he had run
away from his master, but to tell Antalas secretly that Gontharis
wished to share with him the rule of Libya. So the cook carried out
these directions, and Antalas heard the word gladly, but made no
further reply than to say that worthy enterprises are not properly
brought to pass among men by cooks. When this was heard by Gontharis,
he immediately sent to Antalas one of his body-guards, Ulitheus by
name, whom he had found especially trustworthy in his service,
inviting him to come as close as possible to Carthage. For, if this
were done, he promised him to put Areobindus out of the way. So
Ulitheus without the knowledge of the rest of the barbarians made an
agreement with Antalas that he, Antalas, should rule Byzacium, having
half the possessions of Areobindus and taking with him fifteen hundred
Roman soldiers, while Gontharis should assume the dignity of king,
holding the power over Carthage and the rest of Libya. And after
settling these matters he returned to the Roman camp, which they had
made entirely in front of the circuit-wall, distributing among
themselves the guarding of each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxv_11" id="PageIV_xxv_11">[11-21]</a></span>
gate. And the barbarians not
long afterwards proceeded straight for Carthage in great haste, and
they made camp and remained in the place
called Decimum.<a name="FNanchor_67_IV" id="FNanchor_67_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_67_IV" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> And
departing from there on the following day, they were moving forward.
But some of the Roman army encountered them, and engaging with them
unexpectedly, slew a small number of the Moors. But these were
straightway called back by Gontharis, who rebuked them for acting with
reckless daring and for being willing to give the Romans foreknowledge
of the danger into which they were thrown.
</p>
<p>But in the meantime Areobindus sent to Coutzinas secretly and began to
treat with him with regard to turning traitor. And Coutzinas promised
him that, as soon as they should begin the action, he would turn
against Antalas and the Moors of Byzacium. For the Moors keep faith
neither with any other men nor with each other. This Areobindus
reported to Gontharis. And he, wishing to frustrate the enterprise by
having it postponed, advised Areobindus by no means to have faith in
Coutzinas, unless he should receive from him his children as hostages.
So Areobindus and Coutzinas, constantly sending secret messages to
each other, were busying themselves with the plot against Antalas. And
Gontharis sent Ulitheus once more and made known to Antalas what was
being done. And he decided not to make any charges against Coutzinas
nor did he allow him to know that he had discovered the plot, nor
indeed did he disclose anything of what had been agreed upon by
himself and Gontharis. But though enemies and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxv_21" id="PageIV_xxv_21">[21-1]</a></span>
hostile at heart
to one another, they were arrayed together with treacherous intent,
and each of them was marching with the other against his own
particular friend. With such purposes Coutzinas and Antalas were
leading the Moorish army against Carthage. And Gontharis was intending
to kill Areobindus, but, in order to avoid the appearance of aiming at
sole power, he wished to do this secretly in battle, in order that it
might seem that the plot had been made by others against the general,
and that he had been compelled by the Roman army to assume command
over Libya. Accordingly he circumvented Areobindus by deceit, and
persuaded him to go out against the enemy and engage with them, now
that they had already come close to Carthage. He decided, therefore,
that on the following day he would lead the whole army against the
enemy at sunrise. But Areobindus, being very inexperienced in this
matter and reluctant besides, kept holding back for no good reason.
For while considering how he should put on his equipment of arms and
armour, and making the other preparations for the sally, he wasted the
greatest part of the day. He accordingly put off the engagement to the
following day and remained quiet. But Gontharis, suspecting that he
had hesitated purposely, as being aware of what was being done,
decided openly to accomplish the murder of the general and make his
attempt at the tyranny.
</p><br />
<p>XXVI</p>
<p>

And on the succeeding day he proceeded to act as follows. Opening wide
the gates where he himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxvi_1" id="PageIV_xxvi_1">[1-8]</a></span>
 kept guard, he placed huge rocks
under them, that no one might be able easily to shut them, and he
placed armoured men with bows in their hands about the parapet in
great numbers, and he himself, having put on his breastplate, took his
stand between the gates. And his purpose in doing this was not that he
might receive the Moors into the city; for the Moors, being altogether
fickle, are suspicious of all men. And it is not unnatural that they
are so; for whoever is by nature treacherous toward his neighbours is
himself unable to trust anyone at all, but he is compelled to be
suspicious of all men, since he estimates the character of his
neighbour by his own mind. For this reason, then, Gontharis did not
hope that even the Moors would trust him and come inside the
circuit-wall, but he made this move in order that Areobindus, falling
into great fear, might straightway rush off in flight, and, abandoning
Carthage as quickly as he could, might betake himself to Byzantium.
And he would have been right in his expectation had not winter come on
just then and frustrated his plan.
<span class="sidenote">544-545 A.D.</span>

And Areobindus, learning what was being done, summoned Athanasius and
some of the notables. And Artabanes also came to him from the camp
with two others and he urged Areobindus neither to lose heart nor to
give way to the daring of Gontharis, but to go against him instantly
with all his men and engage him in battle, before any further trouble
arose. At first, then, Areobindus sent to Gontharis one of his
friends, Phredas by name, and commanded him to test the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxvi_9" id="PageIV_xxvi_9">[9-16]</a></span>
other's
purpose. And when Phredas returned and reported that Gontharis by no
means denied his intention of seizing the supreme power, he purposed
immediately to go against him arrayed for battle.
</p>
<p>But in the meantime Gontharis slandered Areobindus to the soldiers,
saying that he was a coward and not only possessed with fear of the
enemy, but at the same time quite unwilling to give them, his
soldiers, their pay, and that he was planning to run away with
Anastasius and that they were about to sail very soon from
Mandracium<a name="FNanchor_68_IV" id="FNanchor_68_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_68_IV" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>,
in order that the soldiers, fighting both with hunger
and with the Moors, might be destroyed; and he enquired whether it was
their wish to arrest both and keep them under guard. For thus he hoped
either that Areobindus, perceiving the tumult, would turn to flight,
or that he would be captured by the soldiers and ruthlessly put to
death. Moreover he promised that he himself would advance to the
soldiers money of his own, as much as the government owed them. And
they were approving his words and were possessed with great wrath
against Areobindus, but while this was going on Areobindus together
with Artabanes and his followers came there. And a battle took place
on the parapet and below about the gate where Gontharis had taken his
stand, and neither side was worsted. And all were about to gather from
the camps, as many as were well disposed to the emperor, and capture
the mutineers by force. For Gontharis had not as yet deceived all, but
the majority remained still uncorrupted in mind. But Areobindus,
seeing then for the first time the killing of men (for he had not yet,
as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxvi_16" id="PageIV_xxvi_16">[16-25]</a></span>
happened, become acquainted with this sight), was
terror-stricken and, turning coward, fled, unable to endure what he
saw.
</p>
<p>Now there is a temple inside the fortifications of Carthage hard by
the sea-shore, the abode of men who are very exact in their practice
of religion, whom we have always been accustomed to call "monks"; this
temple had been built by Solomon not long before, and he had
surrounded it with a wall and rendered it a very strong fortress. And
Areobindus, fleeing for refuge, rushed into the monastery, where he
had already sent his wife and sister. Then Artabanes too ran away, and
all the rest withdrew from Carthage as each one could. And Gontharis,
having taken the city by assault, with the mutineers took possession
of the palace, and was already guarding both the gates and the harbour
most carefully. First, then, he summoned Athanasius, who came to him
without delay, and by using much flattery Athanasius made it appear
that what had been done pleased him exceedingly. And after this
Gontharis sent the priest of the city and commanded Areobindus, after
receiving pledges, to come to the palace, threatening that he would
besiege him if he disobeyed and would not again give him pledges of
safety, but would use every means to capture and put him to death. So
the priest, Reparatus, stoutly declared to Areobindus that in
accordance with the decision of Gontharis he would swear that no harm
would come to him from Gontharis, telling also what he had threatened
in case he did not obey. But Areobindus became afraid and agreed that
he would follow the priest immediately, if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxvi_25" id="PageIV_xxvi_25">[25-33]</a></span>
priest, after
performing the rite of
the sacred bath<a name="FNanchor_69_IV" id="FNanchor_69_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_69_IV" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
in the usual manner, should
swear to him by that rite and then give him pledges for his safety. So
the priest did according to this. And Areobindus without delay
followed him, clad in a garment which was suitable neither for a
general nor for any one else in military service, but altogether
appropriate to a slave or one of private station; this garment the
Romans
call "casula"<a name="FNanchor_70_IV" id="FNanchor_70_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_70_IV" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
in the Latin tongue. And when they came near
the palace, he took in his hands the holy scriptures from the priest,
and so went before Gontharis. And falling prone he lay there a long
time, holding out to him the suppliant olive-branch and the holy
scriptures, and with him was the child which had been counted worthy
of the sacred bath by which the priest had given him the pledge, as
has been told. And when, with difficulty, Gontharis had raised him to
his feet, he enquired of Gontharis in the name of all things holy
whether his safety was secure. And Gontharis now bade him most
positively to be of good cheer, for he would suffer no harm at his
hands, but on the following day would be gone from Carthage with his
wife and his possessions. Then he dismissed the priest Reparatus, and
bade Areobindus and Athanasius dine with him in the palace. And during
the dinner he honoured Areobindus, inviting him to take his place
first on the couch; but after the dinner he did not let him go, but
compelled him to sleep in a chamber alone; and he sent there Ulitheus
with certain others to assail him. And while he was wailing and crying
aloud again and again and speaking many entreating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxvi_33" id="PageIV_xxvi_33">[33-8]</a></span>
words to them
to move them to pity, they slew him. Athanasius, however, they spared,
passing him by, I suppose, on account of his advanced age.
</p><br />
<p>XXVII</p>
<p>

And on the following day Gontharis sent the head of Areobindus to
Antalas, but decided to deprive him of the money and of the soldiers.
Antalas, therefore, was outraged, because he was not carrying out
anything of what had been agreed with him, and at the same time, upon
considering what Gontharis had sworn and what he had done to
Areobindus, he was incensed. For it did not seem to him that one who
had disregarded such oaths would ever be faithful either to him or to
anyone else at all. So after considering the matter long with himself,
he was desirous of submitting to the Emperor Justinian; for this
reason, then, he marched back. And learning that Marcentius, who
commanded the troops in Byzacium, had fled to one of the islands which
lie off the coast, he sent to him, and telling him the whole story and
giving pledges, persuaded him by kind words to come to him. And
Marcentius remained with Antalas in the camp, while the soldiers who
were on duty in Byzacium, being well disposed to the emperor, were
guarding the city of Hadrumetum. But the soldiers of Stotzas, being
not less than a thousand, perceiving what was being done, went in
great haste, with John leading them, to Gontharis; and he gladly
received them into the city. Now there were five hundred Romans and
about eighty Huns, while all the rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxvii_8" id="PageIV_xxvii_8">[8-17]</a></span>
were Vandals. And
Artabanes, upon receiving pledges, went up to the palace with his
Armenians, and promised to serve the tyrant according to his orders.
But secretly he was purposing to destroy Gontharis, having previously
communicated this purpose to Gregorius, his nephew, and to Artasires,
his body-guard. And Gregorius, urging him on to the undertaking, spoke
as follows:</p>
<p>
"Artabanes, the opportunity is now at hand for you, and you alone, to
win the glory of Belisarius&mdash;nay more, even to surpass that glory by
far. For he came here, having received from the emperor a most
formidable army and great sums of money, having officers accompanying
him and advisers in great numbers, and a fleet of ships whose like we
have never before heard tell of, and numerous cavalry, and arms, and
everything else, to put it in a word, prepared for him in a manner
worthy of the Roman empire. And thus equipped he won back Libya for
the Romans with much toil. But all these achievements have so
completely come to naught, that they are, at this moment, as if they
had never been&mdash;except indeed, that there is at present left to the
Romans from the victory of Belisarius the losses they have suffered in
lives and in money, and, in addition, that they are no longer able
even to guard the good things they won. But the winning back of all
these things for the emperor now depends upon the courage and judgment
and right hand of you alone. Therefore consider that you are of the
house of the Arsacidae by ancient descent, and remember that it is
seemly for men of noble birth to play the part of brave men always and
in all places. Now many remarkable deeds have been performed by you
in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxvii_17" id="PageIV_xxvii_17">[17-22]</a></span>
behalf of freedom. For when you were still young, you slew
Acaeius,<a name="FNanchor_71_IV" id="FNanchor_71_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_71_IV" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
the ruler of the Armenians,
and Sittas,<a name="FNanchor_72_IV" id="FNanchor_72_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_72_IV" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
the general
of the Romans, and as a result of this becoming known to the king
Chosroes, you campaigned with him against the Romans. And since you
have reached so great a station that it devolves upon you not to allow
the Roman power to lie subject to a drunken dog, show at this time
that it was by reason of noble birth and a valorous heart that at the
former time, good sir, you performed those deeds; and I as well as
Artasires here will assist you in everything, so far as we have the
power, in accordance with your commands."
</p>
<p>So spoke Gregorius; and he excited the mind of Artabanes still more
against the tyrant. But Gontharis, bringing out the wife and the
sister of Areobindus from the fortress, compelled them to remain at a
certain house, showing them no insult by any word or deed whatsoever,
nor did they have provisions in any less measure than they needed, nor
were they compelled to say or to do anything except, indeed, that
Prejecta was forced to write
to her uncle<a name="FNanchor_73_IV" id="FNanchor_73_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_73_IV" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
that Gontharis was
honouring them exceedingly and that he was altogether guiltless of the
murder of her husband, and that the base deed had been done by
Ulitheus, Gontharis by no means approving. And Gontharis was persuaded
to do this by Pasiphilus, a man who had been foremost among the
mutineers in Byzacium, and had assisted Gontharis very greatly in his
effort to establish the tyranny. For Pasiphilus maintained that, if he
should do this, the emperor would marry the young woman to him, and in
view of his kinship with her would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxvii_22" id="PageIV_xxvii_22">[22-33]</a></span>
give also a, dowry of a large
sum of money. And Gontharis commanded Artabanes to lead the army
against Antalas and the Moors in Byzacium. For Coutzinas, having
quarrelled with Antalas, had separated from him openly and allied
himself with Gontharis; and he gave Gontharis his son and his mother
as hostages. So the army, under the leadership of Artabanes, proceeded
immediately against Antalas. And with Artabanes was John also, the
commander of the mutineers of Stotzas, and Ulitheus, the body-guard of
Gontharis; and there were Moors also following him, led by Coutzinas.
And after passing by the city of Hadrumetum, they came upon their
opponents somewhere near there, and making a camp a little apart from
the enemy, they passed the night. And on the day after that John and
Ulitheus, with a detachment of the army, remained there, while
Artabanes and Coutzinas led their army against their opponents. And
the Moors under Antalas did not withstand their attack and rushed off
in flight. But Artabanes of a sudden wilfully played the coward, and
turning his standard about marched off towards the rear. For this
reason Ulitheus was purposing to kill him when he came into the camp.
But Artabanes, by way of excusing himself, said he feared lest
Marcentius, coming to assist the enemy from the city of Hadrumetum,
where he then happened to be, would do his forces irreparable harm;
but Gontharis, he said, ought to march against the enemy with the
whole army. And at first he considered going to Hadrumetum with his
followers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxvii_33" id="PageIV_xxvii_33">[33-3]</a></span>
and uniting with the emperor's forces. But after long
deliberation it seemed to him better to put Gontharis out of the world
and thus free both the emperor and Libya from a difficult situation.
Returning, accordingly, to Carthage, he reported to the tyrant that he
would need a larger army to meet the enemy. And Gontharis, after
conferring with Pasiphilus, consented, indeed, to equip his whole
army, but purposed to place a guard in Carthage, and in person to lead
the army against the enemy. Each day, therefore, he was destroying
many men toward whom he felt any suspicion, even though groundless.
And he gave orders to Pasiphilus, whom he was intending to appoint in
charge of the garrison of Carthage, to kill all
the Greeks<a name="FNanchor_74_IV" id="FNanchor_74_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_74_IV" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
without
any consideration.
</p><br />
<p>XXVIII</p>
<p>

And after arranging everything else in the very best way, as it seemed
to him, Gontharis decided to entertain his friends at a banquet, with
the intention of making his departure on the following day. And in a
room where there were in readiness three couches which had been there
from ancient times, he made the banquet. So he himself reclined, as
was natural, upon the first couch, where were also Athanasius and
Artabanes, and some of those known to Gontharis, and Peter, a Thracian
by birth, who had previously been a body-guard of Solomon. And on both
the other couches were the first and noblest of the Vandals. John,
however, who commanded the mutineers of Stotzas; was entertained by
Pasiphilus in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxviii_5" id="PageIV_xxviii_5">[5-9]</a></span>
his own house, and each of the other leaders
wherever it suited the several friends of Gontharis to entertain them.
Artabanes, accordingly, when he was bidden to this banquet, thinking
that this occasion furnished him a suitable opportunity for the murder
of the tyrant, was planning to carry out his purpose. He therefore
disclosed the matter to Gregorius and to Artasires and three other
body-guards, bidding the body-guards get inside the hall with their
swords (for when commanders are entertained at a banquet it is
customary for their body-guards to stand behind them), and after
getting inside to make an attack suddenly, at whatever moment should
seem to them most suitable; and Artasires was to strike the first
blow. At the same time he directed Gregorius to pick out a large
number of the most daring of the Armenians and bring them to the
palace, carrying only their swords in their hands (for it is not
lawful for the escort of officers in a city to be armed with anything
else), and leaving these men in the vestibule, to come inside with the
body-guards; and he was to tell the plan to no one of them, but to
make only this explanation, that he was suspicious of Gontharis,
fearing that he had called Artabanes to this banquet to do him harm,
and therefore wished that they should stand beside the soldiers of
Gontharis who had been stationed there on guard, and giving the
appearance of indulging in some play, they were to take hold of the
shields which these guards carried, and waving them about and
otherwise moving them keep constantly turning them up and down; and if
any tumult or shouting took place within, they were to take up these
very shields and come to the rescue on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxviii_9" id="PageIV_xxviii_9">[9-14]</a></span>
run. Such were the
orders which Artabanes gave, and Gregorius proceeded to put them into
execution. And Artasires devised the following plan: he cut some
arrows into two parts and placed them on the wrist of his left arm,
the sections reaching to his elbow. And after binding them very
carefully with straps, he laid over them the sleeve of his tunic. And
he did this in order that, if anyone should raise his sword over him
and attempt to strike him, he might avoid the chance of suffering
serious injury; for he had only to thrust his left arm in front of
him, and the steel would break off as it crashed upon the wood, and
thus his body could not be reached at any point.
</p>
<p>With such purpose, then, Artasires did as I have said. And to
Artabanes he spoke as follows: "As for me, I have hopes that I shall
prove equal to the undertaking and shall not hesitate, and also that I
shall touch the body of Gontharis with this sword; but as for what
will follow, I am unable to say whether God in His anger against the
tyrant will co-operate with me in this daring deed, or whether,
avenging some sin of mine, He will stand against me there and be an
obstacle in my way. If, therefore, you see that the tyrant is not
wounded in a vital spot, do you kill me with my sword without the
least hesitation, so that I may not be tortured by him into saying
that it was by your will that I rushed into the undertaking, and thus
not only perish myself most shamefully, but also be compelled against
my will to destroy you as well." And after Artasires had spoken such
words he too, together with Gregorius and one of the body-guards,
entered the room where the couches were and took his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxviii_14" id="PageIV_xxviii_14">[14-24]</a></span>
 stand
behind Artabanes. And the rest, remaining by the guards, did as they
had been commanded.
</p>
<p>So Artasires, when the banquet had only just begun, was purposing to
set to work, and he was already touching the hilt of his sword. But
Gregorius prevented him by saying in the Armenian tongue that
Gontharis was still wholly himself, not having as yet drunk any great
quantity of wine. Then Artasires groaned and said: "My good fellow,
how fine a heart I have for the deed, and now you have for the moment
wrongfully hindered me!" And as the drinking went on, Gontharis, who
by now was thoroughly saturated with wine, began to give portions of
the food to the body-guards, yielding to a generous mood. And they,
upon receiving these portions, went outside the building immediately
and were about to eat them, leaving beside Gontharis only three
body-guards, one of whom happened to be Ulitheus. And Artasires also
started to go out in order to taste the morsels with the rest. But
just then a kind of fear came over him lest, when he should wish to
draw his sword, something might prevent him. Accordingly, as soon as
he got outside, he secretly threw away the sheath of the sword, and
taking it naked under his arm, hidden by his cloak, he rushed in to
Gontharis, as if to say something without the knowledge of the others.
And Artabanes, seeing this, was in a fever of excitement, and became
exceedingly anxious by reason of the surpassing magnitude of the issue
at stake; he began to move his head, the colour of his countenance
changed repeatedly, and he seemed to have become altogether like one
inspired, on account of the greatness of the undertaking. And Peter,
upon seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxviii_24" id="PageIV_xxviii_24">[24-34]</a></span>
 this, understood what was being done, but he did
not disclose it to any of the others, because, being well disposed to
the emperor, he was exceedingly pleased by what was going on. And
Artasires, having come close to the tyrant, was pushed by one of the
servants, and as he retreated a little to the rear, the servant
observed that his sword was bared and cried out saying: "What is this,
my excellent fellow?" And Gontharis, putting his hand to his right
ear, and turning his face, looked at him. And Artasires struck him
with his sword as he did so, and cut off a piece of his scalp together
with his fingers. And Peter cried out and exhorted Artasires to kill
the most unholy of all men. And Artabanes, seeing Gontharis leaping to
his feet (for he reclined close to him), drew a two-edged dagger which
hung by his thigh&mdash;a rather large one&mdash;and thrusting it into the
tyrant's left side clean up to the hilt, left it there. And the tyrant
none the less tried to leap up, but having received a mortal wound, he
fell where he was. Ulitheus then brought his sword down upon Artasires
as if to strike him over the head; but he held his left arm above his
head, and thus profited by his own idea in the moment of greatest
need. For since Ulitheus' sword had its edge turned when it struck the
sections of arrows on his arm, he himself was unscathed, and he killed
Ulitheus with no difficulty. And Peter and Artabanes, the one seizing
the sword of Gontharis and the other that of Ulitheus who had fallen,
killed on the spot those of the body-guards who remained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxviii_34" id="PageIV_xxviii_34">[34-42]</a></span>
Thus
there arose, as was natural, an exceedingly great tumult and
confusion. And when this was perceived by those of the Armenians who
were standing by the tyrant's guards, they immediately picked up the
shields according to the plan which had been arranged with them, and
went on the run to the banquet-room. And they slew all the Vandals and
the friends of Gontharis, no one resisting.
</p>
<p>Then Artabanes enjoined upon Athanasius to take charge of the money in
the palace: for all that had been left by Areobindus was there. And
when the guards learned of the death of Gontharis, straightway many
arrayed themselves with the Armenians; for the most of them were of
the household of Areobindus. With one accord, therefore, they
proclaimed the Emperor Justinian triumphant. And the cry, coming forth
from a multitude of men, and being, therefore, an exceedingly mighty
sound, was strong enough to reach the greater part of the city.
Wherefore those who were well-disposed to the emperor leaped into the
houses of the mutineers and straightway killed them, some while
enjoying sleep, others while taking food, and still others while they
were awe-struck with fear and in terrible perplexity. And among these
was Pasiphilus, but not John, for he with some of the Vandals fled to
the sanctuary. To these Artabanes gave pledges, and making them rise
from there, sent them to Byzantium, and having thus recovered the city
for the emperor, he continued to guard it. And the murder of the
tyrant took place on the thirty-sixth day of the tyranny, in the
nineteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Justinian.</p>
<span class="sidenote">545-546 A.D.</span>

<p>And Artabanes won great fame for himself from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxviii_42" id="PageIV_xxviii_42">[42-51]</a></span>
this deed among all men.
And straightway Prejecta, the wife of Areobindus, rewarded him with
great sums of money, and the emperor appointed him general of all
Libya. But not long after this Artabanes entreated the emperor to
summon him to Byzantium, and the emperor fulfilled his request. And
having summoned Artabanes, he appointed John, the brother of Pappus,
sole general of Libya. And this John, immediately upon arriving in
Libya, had an engagement with Antalas and the Moors in Byzacium, and
conquering them in battle, slew many; and he wrested from these
barbarians all the standards of Solomon, and sent them to the
emperor&mdash;standards which they had previously secured as plunder, when
Solomon had been taken
from the world.<a name="FNanchor_75_IV" id="FNanchor_75_IV" /><a href="#Footnote_75_IV" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
And the rest of the Moors
he drove as far as possible from the Roman territory. But at a later
time the Leuathae came again with a great army from the country about
Tripolis to Byzacium, and united with the forces of Antalas. And when
John went to meet this army, he was defeated in the engagement, and
losing many of his men, fled to Laribus. And then indeed the enemy,
overrunning the whole country there as far as Carthage, treated in a
terrible manner those Libyans who fell in their way. But not long
afterward John collected those of the soldiers who had survived, and
drawing into alliance with him many Moors and especially those under
Coutzinas, came to battle with the enemy and unexpectedly routed them.
And the Romans, following them up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageIV_xxviii_51" id="PageIV_xxviii_51">[51-52]</a></span>
as they fled in complete disorder,
slew a great part of them, while the rest escaped to the confines of
Libya. Thus it came to pass that those of the Libyans who survived,
few as they were in number and exceedingly poor, at last and after
great toil found some peace.

Since a triumph was granted only to an <i>imperator</i>, after the
establishment of the principate by Augustus all triumphs were
celebrated in the name of the emperor himself, the victorious general
receiving only the <i>insignia triumphalia</i>. The first general to refuse
a triumph was Agrippa, after his campaign in Spain, about 550 years
before Belisarius' triumph in Constantinople.</p>

or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
